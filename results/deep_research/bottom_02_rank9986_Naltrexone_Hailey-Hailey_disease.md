## Question

Here is a pathway that describes how a drug might affect a disease:

**Pathway:** SmallMolecule: Naltrexone | affects | Gene: UGT1A1 | affects | SmallMolecule: Cyclosporine | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | Disease: Hailey-Hailey disease

**Drug:** Naltrexone
**Disease:** Hailey-Hailey disease

What is the biological plausibility of this drug-disease relationship?

Score on a scale of:
- 1 = Totally implausible (doesn't make sense biologically and no support in literature)
- 2 = Seems implausible (no support in literature)
- 3 = Seems plausible (no support in literature)
- 4 = Very plausible (some support in literature)
- 5 = Totally plausible (mechanism already described)

Consider:
- Has this exact mechanism been described in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps in the pathway have support in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps seem biologically plausible even without direct literature support?

# Overview: Naltrexone and Hailey-Hailey Disease Pathway

**Naltrexone** is a small-molecule opioid receptor antagonist primarily used to treat opioid and alcohol dependence at standard doses (50–100 mg/day). At much lower doses (typically 1.5–4.5 mg/day), “low-dose naltrexone” (LDN) has been explored as an off-label therapy for various chronic and inflammatory conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=Findings)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=match%20at%20L617%20numerous%20case,59%2C%2060)). **Hailey-Hailey disease** (HHD), also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus, is a rare autosomal dominant blistering skin disorder caused by mutations in the **ATP2C1** gene (a calcium pump) leading to loss of epidermal keratinocyte adhesion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=Hailey,of%20developing%20infection%20and%20possibly)). Clinically, HHD causes recurrent painful erosions and plaques in intertriginous areas, with flares triggered by heat, friction, and infection ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=acantholysis,epithelia%2C%20which%20helps%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=common,There%20is%20no)). There is no cure, and treatment is challenging – options range from topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors to systemic therapies (antibiotics, retinoids, immunosuppressants) for refractory cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=vegetans%2C%20intertrigo%2C%20contact%20dermatitis%2C%20and,a%20lack%20of%20controlled%20clinical)) ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=epidermal%20keratinocytes,mg%2Fkg%2Fday%20and%20resulted%20in%20almost)).

The proposed **pathway** linking naltrexone to HHD involves multiple steps: *Naltrexone → UGT1A1 → Cyclosporine → Hailey-Hailey disease*. In this hypothesis, naltrexone is thought to **affect** the gene **UGT1A1**, which in turn **affects** the drug **cyclosporine**, an immunosuppressant that has been studied as a treatment for HHD. We will analyze each step of this pathway for biological plausibility and evidence, then evaluate how plausible the overall drug-disease relationship is. Key questions include: Has this exact mechanism been described in scientific literature? Do the intermediate steps have support in research? And are the links biologically sensible even if direct evidence is lacking?

# Naltrexone’s Interaction with UGT1A1

**UGT1A1** (uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1) is a liver enzyme that catalyzes glucuronidation – the conjugation of glucuronic acid to lipophilic molecules to facilitate excretion ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=toxicity%20%20%2019.%20,or%202%2C%20respectively%20%2022)) ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=in%20catalyzing%20estrogen%20%2C%20the,administration%20of%20atazanavir%20as%20well)). UGT1A1 is best known for metabolizing bilirubin; genetic loss-of-function leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in conditions like Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler–Najjar syndrome ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=toxicity%20%20%2019.%20,or%202%2C%20respectively%20%2022)). UGT1A1 also glucuronidates certain drugs and hormones (for example, the active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is cleared by UGT1A1) ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=chrysin%20%20in%20the%20human,a%20central%20role%20in%20the)). Variation in UGT1A1 activity can influence drug levels and toxicity – for instance, patients with low UGT1A1 activity have higher risk of toxicity from irinotecan or atazanavir ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=associated%20with%20Crigler,the%20%204%20gene%20locus)) ([www.wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/gene/e/54658.html#:~:text=in%20catalyzing%20estrogen%20%2C%20the,administration%20of%20atazanavir%20as%20well)).

Naltrexone is not primarily cleared by UGT1A1 (its main metabolic pathway is reduction to 6β-naltrexol by cytosolic aldo-keto reductase) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728519/#:~:text=Naltrexone%2C%20an%20opioid%20antagonist%20primarily,determined%20by%20ultraperformance%20mass%20spectrometry)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728519/#:~:text=genetic%20variation%20,S145C%2FL311V%29%20demonstrates)). However, naltrexone can **interact** with UGT1A1 in a few ways. First, naltrexone itself is listed among substrates of UGT1A1 ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/categories/DBCAT003871#:~:text=Naltrexone%20%20,to%20treat%20rheumatoid%20arthritis%2C%20osteoarthritis)), indicating it undergoes some degree of glucuronidation. In a reference dataset of UGT1A1 substrates, naltrexone appears alongside other drugs known to be glucuronidated (e.g. morphine, acetaminophen) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/categories/DBCAT003871#:~:text=Naloxone%20%20%20,and%20mild%20to%20moderate%20pain)) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/categories/DBCAT003871#:~:text=Naltrexone%20%20%20,small%20cell%20lung%20cancer)). This suggests that UGT1A1 plays a role in naltrexone’s metabolism, although it may be a minor pathway. Second, **chronic naltrexone exposure may affect UGT1A1 activity**. An **animal study** in rats (2008) found that chronic naltrexone treatment selectively **inhibited UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation** of estradiol (measured by reduced estradiol-3-glucuronide formation in liver microsomes) ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=,Enzyme)). In that study, long-term naltrexone or heroin exposure led to lower UGT activity toward estrogens, indicating naltrexone can downregulate or inhibit UGT1A1 in vivo ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=1,Transporter)). While this was a rodent model, it provides **biological plausibility** that naltrexone could modulate UGT1A1 enzyme function or expression. 

Importantly, no clinical studies to date have focused on naltrexone’s effect on UGT1A1 expression in humans. Naltrexone at typical doses has not been reported to cause significant changes in bilirubin levels or drug metabolism via UGT1A1 in patients ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728519/#:~:text=Naltrexone%2C%20an%20opioid%20antagonist%20primarily,determined%20by%20ultraperformance%20mass%20spectrometry)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728519/#:~:text=genetic%20variation%20,S145C%2FL311V%29%20demonstrates)). In one human study, naltrexone treatment did not significantly alter general drug metabolism markers like antipyrine clearance ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=1,Transporter)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728519/#:~:text=Naltrexone%2C%20an%20opioid%20antagonist%20primarily,determined%20by%20ultraperformance%20mass%20spectrometry)), suggesting it’s not a potent inducer/inhibitor of major pathways at therapeutic doses. Nonetheless, the evidence above (in vitro substrate data and rodent experiments) indicates it is **biologically possible** for naltrexone to affect UGT1A1 activity or expression. This could occur through enzyme inhibition or regulatory effects when naltrexone is given chronically, especially if high local liver concentrations are achieved.

# UGT1A1 and Cyclosporine Metabolism

The next link in the pathway is **UGT1A1 affecting cyclosporine**. **Cyclosporine A** is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant widely used to prevent transplant rejection and treat certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Cyclosporine’s pharmacokinetics are complex: it is **rapidly metabolized in the liver**, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and is transported by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), leading to numerous drug–drug interactions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20,oligonucleotide%20alone%20or%20in%20combination)). Unlike many small molecules, cyclosporine is a cyclic peptide with a large molecular weight; metabolism occurs mainly via CYP3A enzymes (producing multiple oxidative metabolites) rather than via UGT-mediated glucuronidation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20,oligonucleotide%20alone%20or%20in%20combination)). To date, **direct glucuronidation of cyclosporine by UGT1A1 is not recognized as a major elimination pathway** in humans. There is little to no literature indicating that UGT1A1 polymorphisms significantly alter cyclosporine levels or efficacy, in contrast to the well-documented effect of CYP3A5 genotype or P-gp on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics.

However, UGT1A1 could **intersect with cyclosporine** in *other* ways. Notably, cyclosporine is known to act as a **potent inhibitor** of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. In vitro studies have shown cyclosporine A can strongly inhibit UGT enzymes’ activity at higher concentrations ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20939765/#:~:text=P450%20selective%20substrates%20and%20inhibitors,values%20in%20a%20range%20of)). For example, one study reported cyclosporine was among compounds that significantly inhibited human UGT1A1 activity in liver microsomes (with low micromolar IC50) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20939765/#:~:text=P450%20selective%20substrates%20and%20inhibitors,values%20in%20a%20range%20of)). This implies that in patients on cyclosporine, the activity of UGT1A1 could be reduced, potentially raising levels of UGT1A1 substrates (like bilirubin or other drugs). Conversely, **reductions in UGT1A1 activity** (due to genetics or other drugs) might influence cyclosporine *toxicity indirectly*. A recent 2022 study in *Metabolites* explored this concept: researchers deliberately **knocked down UGT1A1** in mice using an antisense oligonucleotide to induce mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, then treated the mice with cyclosporine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=of%20physiological%20unconjugated%20,Physiological%20UC)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20could%20be%20a%20promising,treated)). The result was that **mild UGT1A1 inhibition protected against cyclosporine-induced kidney damage** in this model ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20could%20be%20a%20promising,treated)). The elevated bilirubin acted as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, mitigating cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20could%20be%20a%20promising,treated)). This finding suggests an intriguing **indirect link**: UGT1A1 activity (through controlling bilirubin levels) can modulate cyclosporine’s impact on tissues. It’s a special case (therapeutic hyperbilirubinemia to counter drug toxicity) and not a normal pharmacokinetic interaction, but it demonstrates a *biologically plausible interplay*. 

In summary, **there is scant direct evidence that UGT1A1 actively metabolizes or deactivates cyclosporine**. Cyclosporine clearance is dominated by CYP3A/P-glycoprotein pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20,oligonucleotide%20alone%20or%20in%20combination)). The knowledge graph relation “UGT1A1 affects cyclosporine” likely reflects that changes in UGT1A1 activity (through drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms) could influence cyclosporine therapy outcomes indirectly. For instance, by altering bilirubin or other metabolite levels, UGT1A1 might change the risk of cyclosporine side effects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20could%20be%20a%20promising,treated)). Nonetheless, this step of the pathway is **weakly supported in literature**. Unlike many drug–gene pairs, UGT1A1 and cyclosporine are not commonly studied together; most cyclosporine pharmacology reviews do not mention UGT1A1 as a key factor. Thus, from a metabolism standpoint, this link is relatively **implausible or at least very obscure**. It is biologically *possible* (enzymes can have unforeseen minor roles), but if Naltrexone alters UGT1A1, any resulting change in cyclosporine levels or effects would likely be small and not well documented.

# Cyclosporine as a Treatment for Hailey-Hailey Disease

The final link is **cyclosporine treating Hailey-Hailey disease**. HHD is fundamentally a genetic skin barrier disorder, but because it features chronic inflammation and flares, systemic immunosuppressants have been tried in severe cases ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=epidermal%20keratinocytes,mg%2Fkg%2Fday%20and%20resulted%20in%20almost)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=vegetans%2C%20intertrigo%2C%20contact%20dermatitis%2C%20and,a%20lack%20of%20controlled%20clinical)). **Cyclosporine** has a track record of use in dermatology for inflammatory skin diseases (e.g. psoriasis, atopic dermatitis), so dermatologists have experimented with it in HHD, especially for refractory disease. **Case reports and small series** provide *some support* for cyclosporine’s efficacy in HHD:

- A 2017 case report from Turkey described a 56-year-old woman with refractory HHD that responded dramatically to **oral cyclosporine** ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=antibiotics%2C%20antifungals%2C%20corticosteroids%2C%20dapsone%2C%20photo,Topical%20antibiotics)). The patient had failed multiple therapies (topical steroids, antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, plus methotrexate and acitretin systemically) ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=a%2056%20years%20old%20female,an%20alternative%20for%20refractory%20HHD)). **Cyclosporine was started at 2.5 mg/kg/day, and within one month her lesions almost completely cleared** ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of)). After six months, cyclosporine was tapered off, and the patient remained much improved with only minor recurrences treatable by topicals ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of)). The authors concluded that a short course of cyclosporine can be an effective alternative for refractory Hailey-Hailey disease ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=antimicrobials%20and%20topical%20calcineurin%20inhibitors,Cyclosporine%3B%20pemphigus%2C%20benign%20familial%3B%20therapeutics)).

- An open-access 2019 article by Okuno *et al.* reviewed “Therapeutic effects of cyclosporine on Hailey-Hailey disease,” presumably documenting additional cases or mechanistic rationale ([systems.enpress-publisher.com](https://systems.enpress-publisher.com/index.php/ti/article/view/1140#:~:text=Therapeutic%20effects%20of%20cyclosporine%20on,Hailey%20disease)). (Full text data are limited, but the publication in *Trends in Immunotherapy* suggests interest in cyclosporine’s role for this indication.) 

- Expert reviews also mention cyclosporine among systemic options. A 2024 update on HHD therapy notes that **immunosuppressants** like cyclosporine, methotrexate, and systemic corticosteroids have been used anecdotally in difficult cases ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=epidermal%20keratinocytes,mg%2Fkg%2Fday%20and%20resulted%20in%20almost)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=vegetans%2C%20intertrigo%2C%20contact%20dermatitis%2C%20and,a%20lack%20of%20controlled%20clinical)). Cyclosporine is not a first-line treatment given HHD’s rarity and chronic course, but it is reserved for severe flares or recalcitrant disease when rapid control is needed. In practice, responses vary; some patients improve significantly on cyclosporine while others see only modest benefit or relapse after discontinuation ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1063224-treatment#:~:text=In%20patients%20with%20refractory%20cases,value%20in%20some%20anecdotal%20reports)) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1063224-treatment#:~:text=Most%20patients%20with%20familial%20benign,adjunctive%20use%20of%20topical%20corticosteroids)). 

Overall, the **naltrexone→UGT1A1→cyclosporine→HHD pathway** assumes cyclosporine is a viable therapy for HHD, which is **reasonably plausible**. There is **some literature support** (case reports in 2017–2019) that cyclosporine can induce remission of HHD lesions ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of)). Cyclosporine’s role is not yet standard or validated by large studies, but it’s biologically sensible: cyclosporine’s immunosuppressive action may reduce the secondary inflammation and immune-mediated damage that exacerbate HHD lesions ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=antibiotics%2C%20antifungals%2C%20corticosteroids%2C%20dapsone%2C%20photo,Topical%20antibiotics)) ([emedicine.medscape.com](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1063224-treatment#:~:text=In%20patients%20with%20refractory%20cases,value%20in%20some%20anecdotal%20reports)). Thus, the step “cyclosporine treats HHD” is **supported by some evidence** and fits current medical reasoning, albeit as a second- or third-line approach.

# Naltrexone in Hailey-Hailey Disease: Evidence and Mechanisms

Finally, we consider the **overall drug–disease relationship: naltrexone and Hailey-Hailey disease**. Independently of the UGT1A1/cyclosporine metabolic pathway, there is emerging clinical evidence that **naltrexone (particularly low-dose naltrexone)** can **improve HHD**. This is a recent development in HHD management, documented through case series and reports in the last ~6–7 years:

- In **2017**, Albers *et al.* published a case series in *JAMA Dermatology* where **3 patients with severe, recalcitrant HHD achieved complete clinical resolution within 2 months on low-dose naltrexone (3–4.5 mg nightly)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=Findings)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=We%20present%20herein%203%20cases,Hailey%20disease)). Notably, stopping naltrexone led to disease flares, and restarting it produced rapid clearing again ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=In%20this%20case%20series%20of,a%20few%20days%20on%20rechallenge)). The authors considered LDN a promising novel therapy and noted its **low adverse-effect profile** (indeed, the patients had no significant side effects) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=Findings)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=We%20present%20herein%203%20cases,Hailey%20disease)). They speculated on a mechanism: **LDN may influence opioid receptor or toll-like receptor pathways to improve keratinocyte calcium handling, differentiation, and wound healing** in HHD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=success%20of%20these%20cases%20suggests,Hailey%20disease)). In other words, transient opioid receptor blockade might reset immune or stress responses in the skin, aiding the genetic defect’s downstream effects.

- In **2018**, a research letter by Cao *et al.* reported **3 additional HHD cases with variable responses to naltrexone**, highlighting that not everyone has a dramatic remission ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Hailey,demonstrating%20varying%20responses%20to%20naltrexone)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Online%20testimonials%20and%20recent%20publications,agents%2C%20allowing%20for%20simplified%20regimens)). One patient had ~95% clearance on 4.5 mg nightly over 18 months ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Case%201)); another had complete clearance on a higher 12.5 mg dose, relapsed after stopping, then partial control on 4.5 mg ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=A%20woman%20in%20her%2030s,slower%20rate%20than%20on%20the)); a third patient saw only 30% improvement with naltrexone plus adjunctive therapies ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=A%20woman%20in%20her%2060s,the%20next%2010%20days%2C%20requiring)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=control.%20The%20patient%20experienced%2030,are%20exudative%2C%20eroded%2C%20or%20symptomatic)). This letter suggested that **some patients may require higher doses (10–50 mg range) or combination treatments for optimal effect** ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Our%20cases%20suggest%20that%20the,given%20the%20variability%20of%20response)). It reinforced that LDN is generally well tolerated (no serious adverse effects were observed) but that patient expectations should be managed – responses can range from dramatic to modest ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Online%20testimonials%20and%20recent%20publications,agents%2C%20allowing%20for%20simplified%20regimens)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Our%20cases%20suggest%20that%20the,given%20the%20variability%20of%20response)).

- Subsequent reports have continued to support naltrexone’s use. A **2020 case report** in *J Clin Aesthetic Dermatology* described a 50-year-old woman with a 20-year history of refractory HHD who showed **significant improvement within 26 days of starting LDN** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=for%20HHD%2C%20recent%20reports%20have,effective%20option%20to%20resistant%20HHD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=case%20of%20a%2050,HHD%2C%20especially%20in%20recalcitrant%20patients)). The authors emphasized that dermatologists should consider LDN for recalcitrant HHD, given its rapid effect and favorable safety ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=for%20HHD%2C%20recent%20reports%20have,effective%20option%20to%20resistant%20HHD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=significant%20clinical%20improvement%20of%20the,effective%20option%20to%20resistant%20HHD)). Another small case series (Ibrahim et al. 2017 in *JAMA Derm*, separate from Albers et al.) documented that **three HHD patients experienced at least 80% improvement (one had 90% near-clearance) on LDN with improved quality of life and no adverse events** ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)). These patients’ ages ranged from 40s to 60s, and all had substantial, sustained benefit from naltrexone therapy ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)). 

- Most recently, a **2024 review** on HHD management (Porro *et al.*, published in *An. Bras. Dermatol.*) highlighted LDN as a valuable intervention. It notes **“numerous case series” using naltrexone 1.5–6.25 mg/day in HHD with rapid responses and sustained remissions**, and minimal side effects (transient nausea or dizziness) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=match%20at%20L617%20numerous%20case,59%2C%2060)). Given the accumulating evidence and safety, this review recommends low-dose naltrexone as a **second-line treatment** for HHD (after first-line topical therapies) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=match%20at%20L617%20numerous%20case,59%2C%2060)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=numerous%20case%20series%20using%20naltrexone,59%2C%2060)). This is a significant endorsement from an expert perspective, effectively integrating naltrexone into the therapeutic arsenal for HHD.

In terms of **biological mechanism**, while the exact pathways remain under investigation, the plausibility of naltrexone helping HHD is supported by known pharmacological effects of LDN. Low-dose naltrexone is hypothesized to exert **immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects** that could benefit HHD’s chronic rash. Mechanistically, transient opioid receptor blockade by naltrexone may lead to rebound upregulation of endorphins and enkephalins, which can modulate immune function and tissue repair ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=success%20of%20these%20cases%20suggests,Hailey%20disease)). Additionally, naltrexone (especially its isomer dextro-naltrexone) can antagonize **TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4)** on immune cells, dampening chronic inflammation in skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=success%20of%20these%20cases%20suggests,Hailey%20disease)). The *JAMA Dermatology* case series authors postulated improved **keratinocyte calcium mobilization and differentiation** as a result of these signaling changes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=success%20of%20these%20cases%20suggests,Hailey%20disease)). Improved keratinocyte function would directly address the HHD defect (which is a failure of keratinocyte adhesion due to calcium pump malfunction) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=Hailey,of%20developing%20infection%20and%20possibly)). Therefore, there is a coherent **biological rationale** for naltrexone’s effect: by modulating innate immune receptors and neuroimmune communication, it may create a skin microenvironment conducive to healing HHD lesions.

It should be noted that **none of these studies attribute naltrexone’s benefit to a pharmacokinetic interaction with UGT1A1 or cyclosporine**. The positive clinical results with naltrexone in HHD were observed without concurrently giving cyclosporine or any intentional change in UGT1A1 activity. In fact, the patients in the naltrexone case series typically had failed other therapies and were not on cyclosporine at the time ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=This%20study%20was%20a%20case,to%20at%20least%204%20therapies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7716739/#:~:text=erode%20and%20macerate%20into%20weeping,HHD%2C%20especially%20in%20recalcitrant%20patients)). This suggests that naltrexone’s **therapeutic effect in HHD is largely independent of the UGT1A1→cyclosporine pathway** presented. The pathway in question might instead be relevant to a scenario like drug–drug interaction: for example, if an HHD patient were on cyclosporine and also took naltrexone, could naltrexone (via UGT1A1) alter cyclosporine’s efficacy or toxicity? There is no direct evidence on this, but given our earlier analysis, any such interaction is speculative and likely minor. Clinically, low-dose naltrexone has been added to other therapies (even biologics like dupilumab in one 2024 report) without major issues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11259094/#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20Recalcitrant%20Hailey,2%7D%2C%20Alexa)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036106/#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20Recalcitrant%20Hailey,symptom%20relief%20through%20a%20combination)).

# Plausibility Assessment and Expert Opinions

Bringing together the above points, we evaluate the **biological plausibility** of the naltrexone–Hailey-Hailey disease relationship as described by the pathway:

- **Literature support for the exact mechanism:** The **full chain (Naltrexone → UGT1A1 → Cyclosporine → HHD)** has **not been described in the literature**. There are no studies explicitly demonstrating that naltrexone benefits HHD by inducing UGT1A1 and altering cyclosporine metabolism. Each link is individually grounded in some evidence (as discussed), but the complete sequence is hypothetical. 

- **Support for individual steps:** **Cyclosp💾rine treating HHD** – **yes, some support**: multiple case reports show cyclosporine can clear or improve HHD ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of)). **Naltrexone affecting UGT1A1** – **limited support**: naltrexone is a UGT1A1 substrate and high-dose or chronic exposure can inhibit UGT1A1 activity in animals ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=1,Transporter)), but this is not a well-studied or clinically important effect in humans. **UGT1A1 affecting cyclosporine** – **very little direct support**: UGT1A1 is not a known major metabolizer of cyclosporine, though extreme manipulations of UGT1A1 (antisense-induced hyperbilirubinemia) can modulate cyclosporine toxicity in animal models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20could%20be%20a%20promising,treated)). This middle step remains the weakest link.

- **Biological plausibility of steps without direct evidence:** Even where literature is scant, the steps are *biologically possible*. **Enzyme–drug interactions** are common, so the idea that naltrexone might alter enzyme levels (UGT1A1) is not far-fetched pharmacologically ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=1,Transporter)). That a **metabolic enzyme’s activity could influence a drug’s effect** (UGT1A1 → cyclosporine) is also plausible in principle – for many drug pairs this is true, though for cyclosporine it’s atypical ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9612357/#:~:text=hyperbilirubinemia%20,oligonucleotide%20alone%20or%20in%20combination)). **Cyclosporine helping a blistering skin disease** fits our understanding of immunosuppressants reducing inflammation, which is plausible for HHD flares ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=antibiotics%2C%20antifungals%2C%20corticosteroids%2C%20dapsone%2C%20photo,Topical%20antibiotics)). All components make biological “sense” to a degree, except that the necessity of UGT1A1 in this chain is questionable (HHD can be treated by cyclosporine or naltrexone via other routes, independent of UGT1A1).

- **Expert opinions:** Dermatology experts have reacted positively to the concept of **naltrexone for HHD**, labeling it an innovative low-risk therapy ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)). They acknowledge it as a **second-line option with promising results** in recent literature ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11343000/#:~:text=match%20at%20L617%20numerous%20case,59%2C%2060)). On the other hand, no expert sources suggest that naltrexone works by altering drug metabolism in HHD. Instead, they focus on immunologic and regenerative mechanisms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=success%20of%20these%20cases%20suggests,Hailey%20disease)). The **consensus in expert commentary** is that naltrexone’s efficacy in HHD is real (given multiple patient successes) but more research is needed to clarify its mechanism and optimal dosing ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/articlepdf/2668140/jamadermatology_cao_2018_ld_170041.pdf#:~:text=Our%20cases%20suggest%20that%20the,given%20the%20variability%20of%20response)). Importantly, **no existing guideline or review connects naltrexone with UGT1A1 or cyclosporine in the context of HHD** – this pathway seems to be a theoretical construct rather than an established mechanism.

- **Relevant data and statistics:** The clinical data we have, while from small samples, are compelling: in various series, **the majority of HHD patients on LDN experienced ≥80% improvement or complete clearance** of lesions within weeks ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=Findings)). Remissions were sustained with continued therapy, and relapses occurred on stopping, indicating a true drug effect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=In%20this%20case%20series%20of,a%20few%20days%20on%20rechallenge)). Side effect incidence was near-zero in these reports ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)). These outcomes underscore that **naltrexone has a tangible therapeutic impact on HHD**, which supports a *high plausibility* that the drug can affect the disease. Meanwhile, cyclosporine’s documented success in at least some patients (clearance in 1 month as one case report showed ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of))) confirms that the concept of using cyclosporine for HHD is valid, though not universally effective. No quantitative data link UGT1A1 activity levels to HHD outcomes or to naltrexone/cyclosporine effects, since that connection hasn’t been studied in patients.

Considering all the above, **how plausible is the naltrexone–HHD relationship via the given pathway?** It appears **biologically *plausible*** overall, but the exact pathway is somewhat convoluted and not experimentally confirmed. **Most of the steps have at least some support** in research or clinical observation, but **not all steps are proven directly in this context**:

- *Naltrexone helping HHD* – observed in practice (multiple case series), so we know the drug-disease relationship *can* exist ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817589/#:~:text=Findings)). This strongly boosts plausibility.
- *Mechanistic understanding* – alternative mechanisms (immune modulation) likely explain the above, rather than the UGT1A1/cyclosporine route. The pathway as written hasn’t been verified.
- *UGT1A1/cyclosporine intermediary* – possible but not necessary for naltrexone to work in HHD, making that specific chain less likely as the true explanation.

# **Biological Plausibility Score: 4/5 (Very Plausible)**

On a 1–5 scale of plausibility, we would rate this naltrexone–Hailey-Hailey disease relationship as **“4 – Very plausible.”** This score is justified because **there is some support in the literature for a beneficial naltrexone–HHD connection**, though the **exact UGT1A1-mediated mechanism is not described**. Naltrexone’s therapeutic effect in HHD is documented in case studies (indicating the relationship is real), and cyclosporine is a known therapy for HHD in some cases ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=also%20unsuccessful,Short%20course%20of)) ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2646785#:~:text=Results%C2%A0%20The%203%20patients%20included,No%20adverse%20effects%20were%20recorded)). The **majority of steps in the proposed pathway are biologically sensible** and at least partially evidenced (naltrexone can affect drug-metabolizing enzymes ([www.hmdb.ca](https://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0014842/metabolite_protein_links#:~:text=1,Transporter)); cyclosporine can treat HHD ([www.turkiyeklinikleri.com](https://www.turkiyeklinikleri.com/article/en-successful-treatment-of-hailey-hailey-disease-with-systemic-cyclosporine-case-report-79065.html#:~:text=antibiotics%2C%20antifungals%2C%20corticosteroids%2C%20dapsone%2C%20photo,Topical%20antibiotics))). However, **because the precise chain has not been conclusively proven or elaborated in research**, we stop short of a “5 – Totally plausible (mechanism already described).” In summary, it makes biological sense that naltrexone could help HHD patients, but likely **by a different mechanism** than the UGT1A1→cyclosporine pathway. The drug-disease link is credible and supported (“very plausible”), even as the proposed intermediary steps remain hypothetical.
