## Question

Here is a pathway that describes how a drug might affect a disease:

**Pathway:** SmallMolecule: Olaparib | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | Disease: neuroblastoma | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | SmallMolecule: Rucaparib | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | Disease: ovarian cancer

**Drug:** Olaparib
**Disease:** ovarian cancer

What is the biological plausibility of this drug-disease relationship?

Score on a scale of:
- 1 = Totally implausible (doesn't make sense biologically and no support in literature)
- 2 = Seems implausible (no support in literature)
- 3 = Seems plausible (no support in literature)
- 4 = Very plausible (some support in literature)
- 5 = Totally plausible (mechanism already described)

Consider:
- Has this exact mechanism been described in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps in the pathway have support in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps seem biologically plausible even without direct literature support?


## Output

# Introduction
**Olaparib** is a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). It was the first PARP inhibitor developed for cancer therapy, targeting tumors with defects in DNA repair ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=Atlas%20Research%20Network%2C%202011%20%29,based%20CHT%20%28%2018%20FDA)). The query proposes an indirect pathway linking Olaparib to **ovarian cancer** via intermediate steps: Olaparib’s use in **neuroblastoma** and the neuroblastoma use of another PARP inhibitor, **Rucaparib**, which is a treatment for ovarian cancer. In essence, this suggests that Olaparib might be effective against ovarian cancer because both Olaparib and Rucaparib target similar mechanisms in DNA repair. Here we examine the biological plausibility of the Olaparib–ovarian cancer relationship, considering mechanistic rationale, supporting literature for each step, real-world clinical data, and expert analyses.

# Mechanistic Basis: PARP Inhibition and Synthetic Lethality  
Olaparib’s anticancer effect is founded on the concept of **synthetic lethality** in DNA repair-deficient cells. PARP enzymes (especially PARP-1) help repair single-strand DNA breaks; Olaparib inhibits PARP activity, causing single-strand breaks to persist and collide with replication, leading to double-strand breaks ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=The%20suppression%20of%20PARP%20results,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)). Normally, cells use homologous recombination repair (HRR) to fix double-strand breaks. However, if a tumor has a defect in HRR – for example, due to mutations in **BRCA1 or BRCA2** or related genes – it cannot properly repair the DNA damage caused by PARP inhibition. In such **HR-deficient (HRD)** or BRCA-mutant tumor cells, the combination of PARP inhibition and an existing HRR defect is lethal, resulting in cancer cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=The%20suppression%20of%20PARP%20results,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=whose%20mechanism%20of%20action%20relies,17%20The%20Cancer%20Genome)). This mechanism was first described in 2005 (Farmer et al.) and has been extensively validated since ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=homologous%20recombination%20repair%20,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)). 

Importantly, ovarian cancers often exhibit the very DNA-repair defects that PARP inhibitors exploit. Approximately *50% of ovarian carcinomas* have some form of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and around *22%* carry a germline or somatic **BRCA1/2** mutation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=whose%20mechanism%20of%20action%20relies,17%20The%20Cancer%20Genome)). These mutations confer heightened sensitivity to PARP inhibition, as demonstrated by both preclinical and clinical studies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=homologous%20recombination%20repair%20,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=notably%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9Csynthetic%20lethality%E2%80%9D,17%20The%20Cancer%20Genome)). Thus, biologically, there is a strong rationale that a PARP inhibitor like Olaparib can be effective in ovarian cancer: the drug targets a DNA repair pathway in which ovarian tumors frequently have vulnerabilities. This exact mechanism – PARP blockade inducing lethal DNA damage in BRCA/HRD tumor cells – **has been clearly described in the literature** and underpins the use of PARP inhibitors in oncology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=The%20suppression%20of%20PARP%20results,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=whose%20mechanism%20of%20action%20relies,17%20The%20Cancer%20Genome)).

# Evidence from Intermediate Steps in the Pathway  
The presented pathway hypothesizes a link from Olaparib to ovarian cancer via neuroblastoma and Rucaparib. We examine each step for support:

**1. Olaparib and Neuroblastoma:** Neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor that, while biologically distinct from ovarian cancer, can harbor DNA repair deficiencies. PARP inhibitors have been explored in neuroblastoma to exploit similar synthetic-lethality principles. Preclinical studies indicated that **high PARP-1 activity/expression in neuroblastoma** correlates with genomic instability and aggressive disease, suggesting these tumors could be susceptible to PARP inhibition ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=the%20non,1%20inhibition)). In vitro research confirmed that Olaparib can potentiate DNA damage and cell death in neuroblastoma cells, especially when combined with DNA-damaging treatments. For example, combining Olaparib with radiation or radiotherapy agents significantly increased DNA damage and cell kill in neuroblastoma cell lines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=By%20combining%20PARP,than%20either%20single%20agent%20alone)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=Rucaparib%20and%20olaparib%20sensitise%20cancer,neuroblastoma%20patients%20may%20be%20beneficial)). These findings led researchers to propose that adding PARP inhibitors could improve neuroblastoma therapy outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=Rucaparib%20and%20olaparib%20sensitise%20cancer,neuroblastoma%20patients%20may%20be%20beneficial)).

Crucially, early clinical data support Olaparib’s activity in neuroblastoma. In 2022, the first Phase 1 trial of Olaparib in pediatric solid tumors reported that Olaparib was well-tolerated in children and showed **preliminary anti-tumor effects** in DNA repair–defective tumors ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20This%20report%20is%20the,defective%20pediatric%20tumors)). Notably, **partial tumor responses were observed in two patients**, one with Wilms’ tumor and one with **refractory neuroblastoma**, treated with Olaparib monotherapy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=substantial%20inhibition%20of%20PARP%20activity,with%20Wilms%20tumor%20and%20neuroblastoma)). The trial found that nearly half of evaluated advanced neuroblastomas had evidence of DNA damage response defects, and those patients responded to PARP inhibition ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=patients%20with%20refractory%20childhood%20solid,defective%20pediatric%20cancers)). These results demonstrate that neuroblastomas with HR repair deficiencies can indeed be impacted by Olaparib, lending **some support in the literature** for the first step of the pathway (Olaparib → neuroblastoma). While Olaparib is not an established neuroblastoma treatment yet, the concept is biologically plausible and under active investigation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=patients%20with%20refractory%20childhood%20solid,defective%20pediatric%20cancers)).

**2. Neuroblastoma and Rucaparib:** The pathway’s middle link implies an association between neuroblastoma and the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib. Rucaparib, like Olaparib, inhibits PARP-1 and PARP-2, and has similar mechanisms of action. Although Rucaparib is primarily used in adult cancers, laboratory studies have examined its effects on neuroblastoma models. **Preclinical evidence** shows that Rucaparib can enhance the efficacy of other therapies in neuroblastoma. For instance, adding Rucaparib improved the tumor-killing effect of the DNA-alkylating drug temozolomide in neuroblastoma cell and animal models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=PARP,2%5D.%20However%2C%20to%20our)). Another study found that Rucaparib (as well as Olaparib) could **radiosensitize** neuroblastoma cells – meaning it made the cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=PARP,to%20demonstrate%20the%20radiosensitising%20potential)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=By%20combining%20PARP,than%20either%20single%20agent%20alone)). In combination with targeted radiotherapy (^131I-MIBG) or X-rays, Rucaparib roughly halved the radiation dose needed to kill neuroblastoma cells in vitro ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=By%20combining%20PARP,than%20either%20single%20agent%20alone)). These findings are consistent with the idea that inhibiting PARP in neuroblastoma prevents DNA repair of therapy-induced damage, thereby enhancing cancer cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=achieve%2050%C2%A0,than%20either%20single%20agent%20alone)). While neuroblastoma “treats Rucaparib” is not a typical phrasing, the data indicate Rucaparib *has been studied in the context of neuroblastoma*. The literature thus **supports most steps of this connection**: neuroblastoma cells are biologically responsive to PARP inhibition by drugs like Rucaparib ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=PARP,2%5D.%20However%2C%20to%20our)), making the chain from Olaparib → neuroblastoma → Rucaparib scientifically coherent.

**3. Rucaparib and Ovarian Cancer:** The last link – Rucaparib treating ovarian cancer – is firmly **established in both literature and clinical practice**. Rucaparib is a U.S. FDA- and EMA-approved therapy for ovarian cancer, belonging to the same class as Olaparib. In fact, Rucaparib was one of the pioneering PARP inhibitors in the clinic: it was the first PARP inhibitor to enter human trials and later gained approval for advanced ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=progressed%20to%20clinical%20evaluation%20,40%E2%80%9336)). By December 2016, Rucaparib received FDA approval for treatment of recurrent, BRCA-mutated ovarian carcinoma after chemotherapy, and subsequent approvals for maintenance therapy followed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)). Like Olaparib, Rucaparib exploits Homologous Recombination deficiencies in ovarian tumors. **Clinical trials have shown Rucaparib’s efficacy**: for example, as maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, Rucaparib significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared to placebo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=focus%20on%20the%20use%20of,PARPi%20maintenance%20therapy%20and%20guide)). A 2023 review noted that data support Rucaparib’s benefit even as first-line maintenance monotherapy in ovarian cancer, analogous to Olaparib’s role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=Poly%28ADP,olaparib%20plus)). In summary, the step Rucaparib → ovarian cancer has **strong support** – it is not just plausible but realized in current oncology practice, reinforcing the pathway’s logic.

# PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer: Clinical Impact and Expert Insights  
Given the above, the direct **Olaparib → ovarian cancer** connection is highly credible. In fact, Olaparib has arguably **the most documented relationship** with ovarian cancer among PARP inhibitors. It was first approved for ovarian cancer in **December 2014** (U.S. FDA approval) as a treatment for advanced ovarian tumors carrying BRCA1/2 mutations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=In%20December%202014%2C%20the%20FDA,The%20study%20treated%20298)). This made Olaparib the inaugural PARP-targeted therapy for ovarian cancer, based on early trials that showed meaningful tumor responses in heavily pretreated BRCA-mutated patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=In%20December%202014%2C%20the%20FDA,The%20study%20treated%20298)). Since then, a series of landmark phase III trials have firmly established Olaparib’s efficacy in ovarian cancer. For instance, in BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer patients who responded to chemotherapy, maintenance Olaparib therapy **quadrupled the median progression-free survival** (e.g. 19.1 months on Olaparib vs 5.5 months on placebo in the SOLO2 trial) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=SOLO2%2FENGOT,4%C2%A0months)). In newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations, first-line maintenance Olaparib led to an unprecedented median PFS of ~56 months (~4.5 years) compared to ~14 months without it (SOLO1 trial) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=First,n%20%3D%20131)). These dramatic improvements illustrate how effective Olaparib can be against ovarian cancer when the tumor has the appropriate DNA repair vulnerabilities. 

Beyond clinical trial data, pooled analyses confirm the broad benefit of PARP inhibition in this disease. A **2024 meta-analysis** of 20 randomized trials (enrolling 7,832 ovarian cancer patients) found that maintenance PARP inhibitor therapy significantly prolongs survival. Overall, PARP maintenance nearly **halved the risk of disease progression** (Hazard Ratio ~0.40) and reduced the risk of death by roughly one-third (HR ~0.68) compared to placebo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=This%20meta,0.05)). These benefits were most pronounced in patients with BRCA mutations or HRD-positive tumors, but improvements in progression-free survival were observed **regardless of homologous recombination status** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=when%20employed%20as%20maintenance%20therapy,Mart%C3%ADn%20et%20al.%2C%202019)). Such data underscore that Olaparib’s mechanism translates into real-world impact: it **extends remission durations and potentially improves survival** in ovarian cancer patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=This%20meta,0.05)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)). 

Clinical experts widely recognize PARP inhibitors, including Olaparib, as a game-changer in ovarian cancer therapy. As noted in a 2023 expert review by O’Malley *et al.*, PARP inhibitors *“have transformed the ovarian cancer (OC) treatment landscape.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=Poly%28ADP,niraparib%20subsequently%20approved%20in%20the)). Before PARP inhibitors, treatment options for recurrent ovarian cancer were limited, with most patients relapsing after platinum chemotherapy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=Ovarian%20cancer%20,1)). The introduction of targeted therapies like **anti-angiogenics** and PARP inhibitors has significantly improved outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=The%20OC%20treatment%20landscape%20has,with%20maintenance%20bevacizumab%20recommended%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20PARPis%20have%20emerged,and%20Table%20%2019)). Olaparib, in particular, paved the way: it was the first PARP inhibitor approved as a maintenance therapy in the first-line setting for ovarian cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=focus%20on%20the%20use%20of,newly%20diagnosed%20setting%20to%20identify)). Oncologists now routinely test ovarian tumors for BRCA or HRD status to identify those *most likely to benefit* from PARP inhibition ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=maintenance%20monotherapy,PARPis%2C%20they%20were%20generally%20well)). The consensus in the field – reflected in guidelines and expert commentary – is that drugs like Olaparib represent a **targeted, mechanism-driven therapy** that has become a standard of care for eligible ovarian cancer patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=Poly%28ADP,olaparib%20plus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)). In practical terms, this means the Olaparib–ovarian cancer linkage is not only biologically plausible but is already realized through approved indications and widespread clinical use.

# Conclusion and Plausibility Score  
Considering the evidence, the **biological plausibility of the Olaparib–ovarian cancer relationship is exceptionally high**. All components of the proposed pathway are supported by scientific literature and mechanistic understanding:

- The *exact mechanism* by which Olaparib could treat ovarian cancer (PARP inhibition causing synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cancer cells) **has been described in detail in the literature** and is well-understood ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=The%20suppression%20of%20PARP%20results,therapeutic%20approach%20has%20led%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=whose%20mechanism%20of%20action%20relies,17%20The%20Cancer%20Genome)). This mechanism directly applies to many ovarian cancers (especially those with BRCA mutations), providing a clear rationale for efficacy.  
- *Most steps* of the pathway have direct support: Olaparib has shown activity in neuroblastoma models and early trials ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=substantial%20inhibition%20of%20PARP%20activity,with%20Wilms%20tumor%20and%20neuroblastoma)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35593736/#:~:text=patients%20with%20refractory%20childhood%20solid,defective%20pediatric%20cancers)); Rucaparib similarly sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to DNA-damaging therapy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4982014/#:~:text=PARP,2%5D.%20However%2C%20to%20our)); and Rucaparib is an established ovarian cancer drug ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)). The shared mechanism (PARP-1 inhibition) across these steps makes the chain coherent.  
- Every step of the chain is at least **biologically plausible** even if not all are standard clinical practice. Importantly, the final connection (Olaparib treating ovarian cancer) is not merely theoretical – it is a *proven clinical reality*. Olaparib’s efficacy in ovarian cancer is demonstrated by multiple trials and corroborated by real-world outcomes and approvals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160416/#:~:text=In%20December%202014%2C%20the%20FDA,The%20study%20treated%20298)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=This%20meta,0.05)).

**Plausibility Rating: 5 (Totally plausible).** On the 1–5 scale, this relationship deserves a **5**, indicating it is *totally plausible* and in fact already validated. The mechanism of action is known and published, and Olaparib has an established therapeutic role in ovarian cancer. In other words, this drug–disease link makes complete biological sense and is backed by substantial literature and clinical evidence. 

Given the convergence of mechanistic justification, experimental support, and clinical success, the Olaparib–ovarian cancer relationship is as plausible as it gets – effectively **proven** in practice. This high plausibility is reflected in the way PARP inhibitors have moved from hypothesis to clinic, transforming the outlook for patients with BRCA-mutated or HRD-positive ovarian cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10344972/#:~:text=Poly%28ADP,niraparib%20subsequently%20approved%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11457084/#:~:text=Presently%2C%20three%20PARP%20inhibitors%20have,PARP%20inhibitors%20markedly%20enhance%20PFS)). The indirect pathway through neuroblastoma and Rucaparib adds further confidence, showing that each “step” is compatible with known biology. Overall, there is **no biological contradiction** in this chain; instead, there is a strong, evidence-based connection that underlies why Olaparib works in ovarian cancer.
