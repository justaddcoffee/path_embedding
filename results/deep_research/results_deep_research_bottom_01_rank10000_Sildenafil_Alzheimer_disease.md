## Question

Here is a pathway that describes how a drug might affect a disease:

**Pathway:** SmallMolecule: Sildenafil | ameliorates_condition | Disease: systemic sclerosis | regulates | Gene: HSD17B10 | related_to | Disease: Alzheimer disease

**Drug:** Sildenafil
**Disease:** Alzheimer disease

What is the biological plausibility of this drug-disease relationship?

Score on a scale of:
- 1 = Totally implausible (doesn't make sense biologically and no support in literature)
- 2 = Seems implausible (no support in literature)
- 3 = Seems plausible (no support in literature)
- 4 = Very plausible (some support in literature)

- Do all, most, or some of the steps in the pathway have support in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps seem biologically plausible even without direct literature support?


## Output

# Biological Plausibility of Sildenafil for Alzheimer’s Disease

## Introduction  
A proposed pathway suggests that **sildenafil** (a small-molecule drug) could affect **Alzheimer’s disease (AD)** via intermediate steps: sildenafil *ameliorates* **systemic sclerosis (SSc)**, which *regulates* the **HSD17B10** gene, and HSD17B10 is *related to* AD. To evaluate this drug-disease link, we examine each step for biological plausibility and literature support. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) best known for treating erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, while HSD17B10 encodes **17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10**, also known as ABAD (amyloid-beta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase). ABAD is a mitochondrial enzyme implicated in AD pathology by interacting with amyloid-β peptides ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=regulate%20its%20catalytic%20activities.%2017%CE%B2,Even%20in%20the)). Below, we analyze the evidence for each link in the pathway and assess the overall plausibility of sildenafil as a therapy for AD.

## Sildenafil’s Effect on Systemic Sclerosis (Step 1)  
**Sildenafil ameliorates systemic sclerosis:** This step is partially supported. Sildenafil doesn’t cure SSc, but it is used to manage certain SSc symptoms, especially vascular complications. Patients with SSc often suffer from severe Raynaud’s phenomenon and digital ulcers due to microvascular dysfunction. **PDE5 inhibitors** like sildenafil promote vasodilation and have been shown to improve blood flow in SSc-related Raynaud’s phenomenon ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28281457/#:~:text=patients%20with%20systemic%20sclerosis%3A%20a,RP)). For example, a clinical trial found that modified-release sildenafil significantly **reduced the frequency of Raynaud’s attacks** in limited-cutaneous SSc and was well tolerated ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21360507/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Our%20findings%20indicate%20that,treatment%20option%20in%20this%20patient)). Sildenafil is also approved for **pulmonary arterial hypertension**, a complication that can occur in SSc, further supporting its beneficial role in this disease. These uses indicate that **sildenafil can “ameliorate” aspects of systemic sclerosis**, lending some plausibility to the first step of the pathway.

However, it’s important to clarify that sildenafil’s effect in SSc is symptom-focused (improving circulation) rather than modifying the underlying autoimmune fibrosis. There is **no evidence that sildenafil broadly alters SSc disease activity or progression**, only that it provides relief in SSc-related vascular issues. Thus, Step 1 is **biologically plausible and supported by literature** (PDE5i’s are indeed used in SSc), but the impact is limited to certain SSc manifestations ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21360507/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Our%20findings%20indicate%20that,treatment%20option%20in%20this%20patient)).

## Systemic Sclerosis and HSD17B10 Regulation (Step 2)  
**Systemic sclerosis regulates HSD17B10:** This step is the least supported in the pathway. **HSD17B10** (17β-HSD10/ABAD) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in fatty acid and steroid metabolism and is ubiquitously expressed. It plays roles in neurosteroid regulation and mitochondrial function, and notably **binds amyloid-β (Aβ)**, enhancing Aβ’s neurotoxicity in AD ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=regulate%20its%20catalytic%20activities.%2017%CE%B2,Even%20in%20the)). The pathway implies SSc might modulate HSD17B10 expression or activity, which would then impact AD. 

In **current literature, there is no direct evidence** that SSc (an autoimmune fibrotic disease) significantly up- or down-regulates HSD17B10. SSc primarily affects the skin, vasculature, and immune system, and while it causes systemic inflammation, **no studies explicitly link SSc to altered HSD17B10 gene expression**. Large transcriptomic analyses of SSc patient tissues have identified many dysregulated genes related to fibrosis, immune responses, and vascular function, but HSD17B10 has not been reported among key SSc biomarkers or pathways ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37501723/#:~:text=analysis%2C%20molecular%20docking%2C%20and%20pharmacokinetic%2Ftoxicity,%CE%B2%20receptor)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37501723/#:~:text=SLCO2B1%2C%20and%20TIMP1,This%20study%20provides%20new%20sights)). It is biologically *possible* that chronic systemic disease could influence mitochondrial enzymes like HSD17B10 indirectly (since severe illness or inflammation can alter metabolic enzyme levels). Yet, without specific data, this connection remains **speculative**. 

In summary, **Step 2 lacks direct support**. While not utterly impossible biologically, it “seems implausible” that treating SSc would meaningfully alter HSD17B10 in a way relevant to AD. For the purposes of evaluating sildenafil’s link to AD, this intermediate is not well-substantiated by evidence.

## HSD17B10 (ABAD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (Step 3)  
**HSD17B10’s relation to AD:** This step is **strongly supported** by existing research. The HSD17B10 gene product, 17β-HSD10, is identical to **ABAD (amyloid-beta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase)**, which has been implicated in AD pathology. ABAD is a mitochondrial enzyme that, beyond its normal metabolic roles, has a high-affinity binding with Aβ peptides. **ABAD–Aβ interaction** is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage in AD ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=regulate%20its%20catalytic%20activities.%2017%CE%B2,Even%20in%20the)). Studies have shown that **elevated levels of 17β-HSD10/ABAD** are found in AD patient brains and mouse models, and the ABAD–Aβ interaction contributes to Aβ’s neurotoxicity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10743717/#:~:text=PMC%20pmc,were%20not%20secured%20from)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=regulate%20its%20catalytic%20activities.%2017%CE%B2,Even%20in%20the)). Blocking this interaction has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce Aβ-mediated toxicity. Furthermore, 17β-HSD10 is involved in neurosteroid metabolism (e.g. regulating allopregnanolone) and mitochondrial homeostasis, processes that can influence cognitive function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=Type%2010%2017%CE%B2,a%20component%20of%20RNase%20P)). 

In short, **HSD17B10 is clearly related to AD biology**. The gene’s protein product exacerbates Aβ pathology, making it a plausible target or mediator in AD. This provides a rationale that any intervention affecting HSD17B10 activity could impact AD outcomes. (However, as noted above, linking this back to SSc is tenuous.) What’s key is that the last step of the chain – **ABAD’s role in AD – is well-documented**, lending credibility to the idea that modulating HSD17B10 could alter AD progression.

## Evidence Linking Sildenafil to Alzheimer’s Disease  
Even if the exact SSc–HSD17B10 link is weak, **sildenafil’s potential benefits in AD have been directly explored in recent research**. Multiple lines of evidence (epidemiological and experimental) suggest that sildenafil might have neuroprotective or cognitive benefits relevant to Alzheimer’s:

- **Epidemiological Studies:** Large-scale patient data analyses have found a **significant association between sildenafil use and reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s disease**. Notably, a 2021/2022 study mining insurance records (over 7 million people) identified sildenafil as a top drug candidate for AD risk reduction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9097949/#:~:text=We%20developed%20an%20endophenotype%20disease,million%20individuals%2C%20we%20found%20that)). In that analysis, **sildenafil users had a markedly lower risk of developing AD**. One report observed about a **69% reduction in AD incidence** among those taking sildenafil, even after adjusting for confounding conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=association%20between%20sildenafil%20usage%20and,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20AD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=association%20between%20sildenafil%20usage%20and,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20AD)). In other words, **the odds of Alzheimer’s were dramatically lower in the Viagra-using group**. Another 2023 case-control study similarly found AD patients were significantly *less likely* to have taken PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil or tadalafil) in the past – an association seen in both men and women ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=Henry%20et%20al.%20,this%20study%20relied%20on%20retrospective)). Pooled analyses confirm a trend: a **2024 systematic review and meta-analysis** of six studies concluded that PDE5 inhibitor use is linked to **significantly reduced AD risk**, with sildenafil in particular showing the strongest effect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20findings%2C%20the,the%20low%20number%20of%20studies)). In that meta-analysis, only sildenafil (among PDE5 drugs) showed a statistically significant risk reduction (pooled hazard ratio ~0.46), especially in females ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20findings%2C%20the,the%20low%20number%20of%20studies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=subgroup,with%20no)). These converging data from real-world populations suggest that **sildenafil users have a lower prevalence or delayed onset of AD** compared to non-users. Such findings, while observational, strongly support the plausibility of a beneficial link.

- **Mechanistic and Preclinical Studies:** There is also **biological rationale** and experimental evidence that sildenafil could directly affect processes relevant to AD. Sildenafil’s primary action is increasing cyclic GMP (cGMP) by blocking its breakdown (via PDE5 inhibition). cGMP is a second messenger involved in **neuroplasticity, memory formation, and cerebral blood flow regulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21627640/#:~:text=Background%20and%20purpose%3A%20Inhibitors%20of,related%20behaviour%20were%20investigated))**. Research indicates that sildenafil crosses the blood–brain barrier (it is lipid-soluble) and can act on brain tissue ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10584171/#:~:text=match%20at%20L632%20dosages%20and,lives%20%5B26%2C%2034%2C%2047)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=hallmark%20of%20AD,They%20evaluated%20the)). In animal models of AD, **sildenafil improved cognitive function** independent of clearing amyloid plaques. For example, in transgenic AD mice (Tg2576 model), chronic sildenafil treatment **completely reversed memory deficits** in maze tests. Treated AD mice showed **reduced tau hyperphosphorylation** and **lower activity of GSK3β and CDK5** (kinases that drive tau pathology), as well as increased synaptic proteins (BDNF and Arc) in the hippocampus ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21627640/#:~:text=Key%20results%3A%20Treatment%20of%20aged,modification%20of%20brain%20amyloid%20burden)). Notably, this cognitive improvement occurred **without changing amyloid-β plaque levels ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21627640/#:~:text=hippocampus%20by%20a%20reduction%20of,modification%20of%20brain%20amyloid%20burden))**, suggesting sildenafil mainly affected downstream neurodegenerative processes (tau, synaptic health) rather than Aβ accumulation. This aligns with cell-based studies: the recent in silico/lab study that identified sildenafil also demonstrated that sildenafil **down-regulates GSK3β and CDK5** in human microglial cells, and in neurons derived from AD patients’ iPSCs it **increased neurite growth and decreased phospho-tau levels**, bolstering a mechanistic link to reduced tau pathology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9097949/#:~:text=activation,tau)). Additionally, sildenafil’s vasodilatory effect could improve **cerebral blood flow and metabolism** in AD. A clinical pilot study in AD patients showed a single dose of sildenafil significantly **increased brain perfusion and oxygen metabolism**, particularly in memory-related brain regions (e.g. the medial temporal lobes) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29036811/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Complete%20CBF%20and%20CMRO2,decreased%20after%20administration%20of%20sildenafil)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29036811/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Our%20data%20suggest%20that,metabolism%20in%20patients%20with%20AD)). Since vascular dysfunction and hypoperfusion are known contributors to cognitive decline, this acute effect on cerebrovascular function is another biologically plausible way sildenafil might ameliorate AD symptoms or progression.

- **Expert Opinions and Ongoing Research:** Given the above findings, expert researchers are actively discussing sildenafil as a repurposed therapy for Alzheimer’s. In late 2021, Dr. Feixiong Cheng and colleagues (Cleveland Clinic) published the seminal network medicine and data mining study pointing to sildenafil for AD, sparking significant interest ([my.clevelandclinic.org](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/podcasts/health-essentials/could-viagra-lower-your-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-with-feixiong-cheng#:~:text=Could%20Viagra%20Lower%20Your%20Risk,then%2C%20this%20can%20be%20useful)). **Neurologists and geriatric psychiatrists** have noted that PDE5 inhibitors are attractive due to their **established safety profile** in the elderly (from decades of use for erectile dysfunction) and their multi-faceted mechanism (vascular, biochemical) that could target AD’s complexity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=The%20management%20of%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease,and%20the%20risk%20of%20AD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=has%20spotlighted%20the%20promising%20role,and%20the%20risk%20of%20AD)). Some experts caution that **correlation is not causation** – healthier patients or other biases might partly explain lower AD rates in sildenafil users. Yet, the signal is strong enough that researchers call for **prospective clinical trials**. A 2023 PLoS ONE study explicitly concludes that the epidemiological evidence “supports the need for a Phase III clinical trial” of PDE5 inhibitors in Alzheimer’s ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10584171/#:~:text=Background)). As of 2024, small Phase II trials are being designed to test cognitive outcomes with drugs like sildenafil or tadalafil in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD. No regulatory approval exists yet for this indication, but the growing consensus is that **sildenafil is a very promising AD drug candidate** pending confirmation in randomized trials.

- **Counterpoints:** It should be noted not all investigations are uniformly positive. For instance, one 2022 cohort study (the Drug Repurposing for Effective Alzheimer’s Medicines project) reported **no significant association** between new PDE5i use and incident dementia ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-abstract/4/5/fcac247/6731685#:~:text=effect%20,brain%20tissue%20accumulation%20of%20PDE5)). That study also found in vitro that sildenafil did **not enhance microglial amyloid clearance** at certain low concentrations – even observing a slight increase in extracellular Aβ, possibly due to reduced phagocytosis ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-abstract/4/5/fcac247/6731685#:~:text=Sildenafil%20was%20not%20associated%20with,inhibition%20of%20phagocytotic%20activity%20in)). These discrepant findings suggest that if sildenafil has benefits, they might depend on dosage, timing, or patient population. Nonetheless, the **preponderance of recent evidence leans toward a beneficial effect**. Most observational studies (including analyses stratified by comorbidities, sex, and indications) consistently show an *odds ratio < 1* for AD in sildenafil users ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=association%20between%20sildenafil%20usage%20and,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20AD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=Henry%20et%20al.%20,this%20study%20relied%20on%20retrospective)). The negative results are considered by experts as a call to further research rather than a dismissal of the hypothesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10584171/#:~:text=Phosphodiesterase,studies%20have%20offered%20opposing%20conclusions)). In weighing plausibility, these mixed findings temper over-optimism but do not negate the strong mechanistic and epidemiological support outlined above.

## Plausibility Assessment and Score  
Considering all the above, **the biological plausibility of sildenafil benefiting Alzheimer’s disease is quite high**. We have: 

- **Mechanistic overlap:** Sildenafil’s known pharmacology (increasing cGMP) can impact brain processes relevant to memory and neuroprotection. It also potentially counters AD pathologies (vascular deficit, tau hyperphosphorylation) through documented mechanisms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21627640/#:~:text=Key%20results%3A%20Treatment%20of%20aged,modification%20of%20brain%20amyloid%20burden)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29036811/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Complete%20CBF%20and%20CMRO2,decreased%20after%20administration%20of%20sildenafil)). The involvement of HSD17B10 (ABAD) provides a theoretical link—while not proven, ABAD’s role in AD means any effect on that pathway could be meaningful. The idea that a vascular/fibrosis-related condition (SSc) would intersect with a neurodegenerative pathway via ABAD is complex, but not biologically impossible given systemic inflammation’s effect on metabolism. However, **that specific SSc→HSD17B10 connection is the weakest link**, currently unsupported by data. 

- **Literature support:** **Most steps in the proposed pathway have support** in the literature, except the direct SSc–HSD17B10 modulation. Sildenafil’s use in SSc is established (supporting Step 1) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21360507/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Our%20findings%20indicate%20that,treatment%20option%20in%20this%20patient)). HSD17B10’s relevance to AD is well-established (supporting Step 3) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38139430/#:~:text=regulate%20its%20catalytic%20activities.%2017%CE%B2,Even%20in%20the)). The *overall* concept of sildenafil aiding AD is backed by multiple 2021–2024 studies (epidemiological, cell, animal, and human) as detailed above. In fact, this drug-disease pairing has already been described in scientific literature as a repurposing opportunity, with some papers outlining possible **mechanisms (e.g. tau kinase inhibition, improved perfusion)** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21627640/#:~:text=Key%20results%3A%20Treatment%20of%20aged,modification%20of%20brain%20amyloid%20burden)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=hallmark%20of%20AD,showed%20that%20sildenafil%20usage%20was)). This means the **exact mechanism is partially described**, though not fully settled. 

- **Biological sense:** Even setting aside direct literature, the relationship is **biologically plausible**. Sildenafil’s ability to improve vascular function could ameliorate one aspect of AD (circulation to the brain). Its raising of cGMP could enhance synaptic plasticity, potentially improving cognitive function. The fact that PDE5is penetrate the CNS and affect neuron/glia signaling is known ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10584171/#:~:text=match%20at%20L632%20dosages%20and,lives%20%5B26%2C%2034%2C%2047)). Thus, nothing in this proposal blatantly defies known biology; rather, it leverages known drug effects on pathways (vascular, biochemical) that are relevant to AD. The only question mark is whether systemic sclerosis is a necessary part of the chain or just an artifact of how the idea was generated. It’s more likely that **sildenafil could benefit AD *independently*** of any involvement with SSc.

**Conclusion – Plausibility Score:** On the given scale, the sildenafil–Alzheimer’s link would be rated around **4 out of 5 (“very plausible”)**. This indicates that there is **some support in the literature for most components of the relationship**. Indeed, **multiple studies support a connection between sildenafil and reduced AD pathology/risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20findings%2C%20the,the%20low%20number%20of%20studies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11470851/#:~:text=association%20between%20sildenafil%20usage%20and,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20AD))**, and the mechanisms (better cerebrovascular health, interference with tau/Aβ toxicity pathways) **make sense biologically**. The relationship is not “totally plausible (5)” only because we lack direct evidence for every step of the **exact pathway** as written – specifically, the role of systemic sclerosis in modulating HSD17B10 is unproven, and we do not yet have conclusive clinical trials in AD patients. In other words, the **concept is strongly promising but not definitively proven**. 

All things considered, sildenafil emerges as a **very plausible candidate for Alzheimer’s disease therapy**, with supportive epidemiological data and mechanistic reasoning in recent research. Most steps in the hypothetical pathway are grounded in evidence, even if the full chain has not been observed in one continuous experiment. Future clinical trials will ultimately determine if this repurposed drug can translate into a real-world treatment for Alzheimer’s, but current knowledge provides a solid rationale (score 4/5) for optimism.
