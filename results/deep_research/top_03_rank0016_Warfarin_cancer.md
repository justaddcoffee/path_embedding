## Question

Here is a pathway that describes how a drug might affect a disease:

**Pathway:** SmallMolecule: Warfarin | treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat | Disease: cancer | genetically_associated_with | Gene: MLH1 | genetically_associated_with | Disease: cancer

**Drug:** Warfarin
**Disease:** cancer

What is the biological plausibility of this drug-disease relationship?

Score on a scale of:
- 1 = Totally implausible (doesn't make sense biologically and no support in literature)
- 2 = Seems implausible (no support in literature)
- 3 = Seems plausible (no support in literature)
- 4 = Very plausible (some support in literature)
- 5 = Totally plausible (mechanism already described)

Consider:
- Has this exact mechanism been described in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps in the pathway have support in the literature?
- Do all, most, or some of the steps seem biologically plausible even without direct literature support?

# Warfarin and Its Mechanism of Action  
**Warfarin** is a small-molecule anticoagulant (blood thinner) that has been in medical use since the 1950s ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20,heart%20attack%2C%20or%20pulmonary%20embolism)). It works by inhibiting the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), which is needed to recycle vitamin K into its active form ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%29,tumour%20natural)). By depleting active vitamin K, warfarin prevents the **γ-carboxylation** of certain proteins, notably the clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, which is why it effectively **prevents blood clot formation** ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2018.8562?text=fulltext#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20the%20most%20commonly,window%2C%20which%20means%20that%20a)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2018.8562?text=fulltext#:~:text=differences%20in%20warfarin%20dose%20response,Genetic%20polymorphisms%20of)). Warfarin’s narrow therapeutic window and patient variability have made dosing challenging in practice ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2018.8562?text=fulltext#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20the%20most%20commonly,window%2C%20which%20means%20that%20a)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2018.8562?text=fulltext#:~:text=warfarin%20maintenance%20dose,warfarin%20have%20been%20conducted%20worldwide)), but it remains a mainstay therapy for conditions like deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mmr.2018.8562?text=fulltext#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20the%20most%20commonly,window%2C%20which%20means%20that%20a)). Importantly, besides clotting factors, warfarin also blocks the activation of other vitamin K–dependent proteins in the body ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=associated%20with%20aggressive%20cancer%20and,0%20%CE%BCM%29%20warfarin%20treatment%20impedes)). For example, **Gas6**, a protein that binds the AXL receptor on cells, requires vitamin K–dependent modification to function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=associated%20with%20aggressive%20cancer%20and,below%20that%20required%20to)). This broad mechanism of action has prompted interest in warfarin’s effects beyond coagulation.

# MLH1 and Its Role in Cancer  
**MLH1 (MutL Homolog 1)** is a key gene in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, crucial for fixing replication errors. Loss-of-function mutations in MLH1 prevent proper DNA repair, leading to accumulation of mutations (especially at microsatellite repeats) and contributing to cancer development ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=Mismatch%20repair%20deficiency%20,are%20PCR%20and%20next%20generation)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=designated%20as%20microsatellite%20instability%20%28MSI%29,as%20tumor%20immunogenicity%2C%20facilitate%20the)). In the hereditary context, a germline mutation in one MLH1 allele causes **Lynch syndrome** (previously called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), which predisposes carriers to a very high lifetime risk of colorectal and other cancers ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=population%20is%20highest%20for%20PMS2,by%20MSH3%20and%20MLH3%2C%20respectively)). In Lynch syndrome patients, only one additional “hit” (somatic MLH1 inactivation) can initiate tumor formation ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=The%20constitutional%20pathway%20occurs%20in,65)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=Due%20to%20a%20germline%20mutation%2C,44)). MLH1 defects also occur in sporadic cancers: for example, about **15–20% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas** have MMR deficiency, often due to MLH1 promoter hypermethylation that silences the gene ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%20colorectal%20carcinomas,result%20is%20the%20presence%20of)). Thus, MLH1 is a well-established **tumor suppressor gene**, and its inactivation (inherited or acquired) is **genetically associated with cancer** risk and development. Cancers arising from MLH1 dysfunction (so-called MSI-H or microsatellite-unstable tumors) tend to have high mutation burdens and distinct clinical behaviors, including strong immunogenicity and responsiveness to immunotherapies ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=designated%20as%20microsatellite%20instability%20%28MSI%29,as%20tumor%20immunogenicity%2C%20facilitate%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=allows%20the%20recognition%20of%20carriers,colorectal%2C%20gastroesophageal%2C%20and%20endometrial%20adenocarcinomas)). In summary, MLH1’s integrity is vital for genomic stability, and its loss is intimately linked to oncogenesis.

# Warfarin’s Potential Anti-Cancer Effects – Mechanisms and Evidence  
Although warfarin is not a standard chemotherapeutic, accumulating evidence suggests it **may have anti-cancer properties**. Researchers have observed since the 1960s that patients on warfarin sometimes had slower tumor progression or fewer metastases, but these observations were anecdotal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Vitamin%20K%20%E2%80%9Cantagonists%E2%80%9D%20have%20been,poor%20patient%20outcome%20in%20several)). Formal clinical trials in the 1980s–1990s tested warfarin in cancer patients (for example, adding low-dose warfarin to chemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer), but results were inconsistent and often **showed no significant survival benefit** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9363869/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Warfarin%20does%20not%20appear,anticoagulants%20observed%20in%20previous%20studies)). A likely reason is that high-dose warfarin causes full anticoagulation (raising bleeding risk), which complicated those trials ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Vitamin%20K%20%E2%80%9Cantagonists%E2%80%9D%20have%20been,poor%20patient%20outcome%20in%20several)). More recent studies have revisited warfarin at lower or carefully controlled doses, uncovering **novel anti-tumor mechanisms** distinct from its anticoagulant effect.

**Gas6–AXL Pathway Inhibition:** One well-described mechanism is warfarin’s effect on the **Gas6/AXL signaling pathway** in cancer cells. Gas6 is a vitamin K–dependent protein that activates the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, which is implicated in cancer cell survival, metastasis, and immune evasion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=warfarin%20are%20generally%20attributed%20to,mediated%20Axl%20activation)). Warfarin prevents Gas6 from being γ-carboxylated (activated), thereby **blocking AXL signaling at doses below those needed for anticoagulation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=associated%20with%20aggressive%20cancer%20and,0%20%CE%BCM%29%20warfarin%20treatment%20impedes)). In 2015, Kirane et al. demonstrated that **low-dose warfarin (IC_50 ≈ 0.6 nM)** was enough to inhibit Gas6-mediated AXL activation on tumor cells without affecting blood coagulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=associated%20with%20aggressive%20cancer%20and,0%20%CE%BCM%29%20warfarin%20treatment%20impedes)). In pancreatic cancer models, such AXL inhibition had striking effects: **warfarin treatment halted the progression and spread of pancreatic tumors** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)). Specifically, warfarin hindered cancer cell migration, invasion, and **epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition** (a key process in metastasis), while increasing tumor cell apoptosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)). Four out of five tested pancreatic tumor models showed a significant reduction in metastatic burden with warfarin, corresponding to those tumors that expressed AXL (the one non-responsive model lacked AXL expression) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=inhibited%20metastatic%20burden%20%28Fig,Furthermore%2C%20Gas6%20was%20expressed%20at)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=match%20at%20L239%20Axl%20has,culture%20was%20inhibited%20by%20warfarin)). In essence, **Gas6-induced AXL signaling is a driver of cancer aggressiveness, and warfarin’s blockade of this pathway can suppress metastasis and growth** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Repurposing%20%E2%80%98old%E2%80%99%20drugs%20can%20facilitate,Here%20we%20show%20that)). This has been corroborated by other researchers: a recent review notes that warfarin **“inhibits AXL receptor signalling, blocking the malignant traits of aggressive carcinoma cells and enhancing anti-tumor natural killer cell activity at doses that do not affect coagulation.”** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%20%29,69)) Warfarin’s unique ability to target this vitamin K-dependent pro-metastatic pathway sets it apart from newer anticoagulants (which don’t affect vitamin K) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%20%29,69)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Recently%2C%20four%20randomized%20clinical%20trials,dabigatran%20on%20tumour%20growth%20and)).

**Ferroptosis and VKORC1L1:** Another breakthrough came in 2023, when scientists linked warfarin to the emerging concept of **ferroptosis** (iron-dependent cell death). Tumor cells often evade “programmed cell death” mechanisms; one such mechanism is ferroptosis, which can kill cells that have accumulated genomic damage or oxidative stress. A Columbia University team discovered that **VKORC1L1**, a vitamin K epoxide reductase paralog (and a target of warfarin), acts as a potent **ferroptosis inhibitor in cancer cells** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37467745/#:~:text=Cite%20Display%20options%20,VKORC1L1%20protects%20cells)). Loss of VKORC1L1 activity made cancer cells much more susceptible to ferroptosis. Notably, **p53 (a master tumor-suppressor)** was found to downregulate VKORC1L1 as part of its tumor-suppressive program ([data.mendeley.com](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8mxhzbr3v3#:~:text=10,identified%20vitamin%20K%20epoxide%20reductase)) ([www.thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23950475#:~:text=Paper%20www,3%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%B4%E6%8E%A5%E8%BD%AC%E5%BD%95%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6%E9%9D%B6%E6%A0%87%E3%80%82p53%E6%BF%80%E6%B4%BB%E5%90%8E%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%9C%A8mRNA%E5%92%8C%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6VKORC1L1%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%A8%E8%BE%BE%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%8E%E8%80%8C%E4%BD%BF%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E%E5%AF%B9%E9%93%81%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%A1%E8%AF%B1%E5%AF%BC%E6%9B%B4%E6%98%93%E6%84%9F%E3%80%82p53%E7%BC%BA%E5%A4%B1%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E%E8%A1%A8%E7%8E%B0%E5%87%BAVKORC1L1%E8%9B%8B%E7%99%BD%E5%92%8C%20mRNA%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8A%E8%B0%83%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E%E9%87%8E%E7%94%9F%E5%9E%8Bp53%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E8%B0%83%E6%8E%A7%E5%85%B6%E5%86%85%E6%BA%90%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%A8%E8%BE%BE%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E3%80%82%20%E5%8F%A6%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87%E5%AF%B9TCGA%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E8%82%BF%E7%98%A4%E6%A0%B7%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%ADVKORC1L1%E7%9A%84mRNA%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%EF%BC%8C%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E5%9B%A2%E9%98%9F%E5%8F%91%E7%8E%B0%EF%BC%8C%E6%AF%94%E8%B5%B7p%2053%E9%87%8E%E7%94%9F%E5%9E%8B%EF%BC%8Cp53%E7%AA%81%E5%8F%98%E7%9A%84%E8%82%BF%E7%98%A4%E6%A0%B7%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%ADVKORC1L1%E7%9A%84mRNA%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E6%98%8E%E6%98%BE%E4%B8%8A%E5%8D%87%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8EVKORC1L1%E5%BE%88%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8E%E4%BA%86p53%E7%AA%81%E5%8F%98%E8%82%BF%E7%98%A4%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%A3%E8%B0%A2%E9%87%8D%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B%E3%80%82%20%E5%8D%8E%E6%B3%95%E6%9E%97%EF%BC%88Warfarin)). By inhibiting VKORC1L1, **warfarin essentially mimics this p53 effect**: it prevents cancer cells from blocking ferroptosis. In experimental models, warfarin treatment **sensitized human pancreatic cancer cells to ferroptotic death and **“strongly repressed tumor growth”** in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). In other words, warfarin **“stops tumors from interfering with a self-destruct mechanism”** (ferroptosis) that would normally kill cells with dangerous mutations ([www.technologynetworks.com](https://www.technologynetworks.com/drug-discovery/news/study-investigates-the-possible-anti-cancer-properties-of-warfarin-377366#:~:text=Read%20time%3A%202%20minutes)). This novel mechanism helps explain warfarin’s direct anti-tumor impact beyond just preventing blood clots. It also suggests warfarin might synergize with therapies that induce oxidative stress in cancer cells.

**Anti-Metastatic and Immune Effects:** Warfarin may also inhibit cancer spread through its anticoagulant properties, by altering the tumor microenvironment in the bloodstream. Normally, circulating tumor cells can cloak themselves in fibrin (blood clots) and platelets, which protects them from immune attack and aids in lodging at distant sites. By **preventing fibrin formation around tumor cells**, warfarin can expose these cells to immune surveillance, making them more vulnerable to destruction by immune cells ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=growth%20or%20metastasis%20in%20almost,69)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=involve%20prevention%20of%20fibrin%20formation,69)). Preclinical studies support this: warfarin significantly reduced the number of lung metastases in mice **when given prophylactically before tumor cells were introduced** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=inhibition%2C%20as%20well%20as%20metastasis,the%20ligand%20of%20the%20AXL)). (However, if warfarin was started only after tumors were established, its impact on existing tumor growth was less dramatic ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=inhibition%2C%20as%20well%20as%20metastasis,to%20clearance%20by%20immune%20cells)), indicating warfarin’s benefits may be strongest in preventing the early steps of metastasis.) Warfarin’s ability to enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity, as noted above with AXL inhibition, also ties into an immune-mediated anti-tumor effect ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%20%29,69)). These insights align with decades-old observations that cancer patients in hypercoagulable states have worse outcomes and that anticoagulation can sometimes improve prognosis ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=growth%20or%20metastasis%20in%20almost,69)).

**Scope of Evidence:** A 2024 systematic review compiled results from **157 preclinical studies** of anticoagulants in cancer models, including 20 studies on warfarin across various tumor types ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Warfarin%20was%20evaluated%20in%2020,4%E2%80%85mg%2FL%20%28average)). The meta-analysis found **statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis** in the studies involving warfarin ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%206%2C158,tumour%20growth%20and%20metastasis%20inhibition)). Warfarin was tested in models of lung cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and others, often showing reduced metastatic spread especially when administered early ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Warfarin%20was%20evaluated%20in%2020,to%2028%20days%20with%20mean%E2%80%89%C2%B1%E2%80%89SD)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=inhibition%2C%20as%20well%20as%20metastasis,the%20ligand%20of%20the%20AXL)). These broad findings reinforce that warfarin’s anti-cancer effect is not confined to a single cancer type – many aggressive tumors that rely on coagulation pathways or AXL signaling could, in principle, be suppressed by warfarin. It should be noted that not every experiment saw an effect on primary tumor size, and some warfarin-sensitive outcomes depended on tumor-specific factors like AXL expression or timing of administration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=inhibited%20metastatic%20burden%20%28Fig,Furthermore%2C%20Gas6%20was%20expressed%20at)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=inhibition%2C%20as%20well%20as%20metastasis,the%20ligand%20of%20the%20AXL)). Still, the **preclinical evidence consistently indicates that warfarin has biologically plausible anti-tumor activities** via multiple mechanisms.

# Observational and Clinical Data on Warfarin in Cancer  
Beyond the lab, epidemiological data provide real-world insight into warfarin’s potential impact on cancer. A landmark **2017 population-based cohort study** (Haaland et al., published in *JAMA Internal Medicine*) analyzed over 1.25 million people over 50, comparing cancer rates among warfarin users vs. non-users ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=Findings)). The results were striking: warfarin users had a significantly lower overall cancer incidence (Incidence Rate Ratio ~0.84, meaning **16% lower risk**) than those not on warfarin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)). This protective association spanned many cancer types – for example, warfarin use correlated with lower lung cancer risk (IRR ~0.80) and especially lower prostate cancer risk (IRR ~0.69, **31% reduction**) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)). Breast cancer incidence was modestly lower as well (~10% reduction) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)). Interestingly, **colorectal cancer** incidence was *not* significantly different overall in warfarin users vs non-users (IRR ~0.99, no reduction) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.81)). However, in a subgroup of patients who were on warfarin specifically for atrial fibrillation (often indicating longer-term anticoagulation), even colon cancer incidence was lower (IRR ~0.71 in that subgroup) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=0.99%3B%2095%25%20CI%2C%200.93,0.81)). The authors concluded that warfarin might have a **“broad anticancer potential”** across a range of malignancies in the general population ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance)). They noted this could influence how doctors choose anticoagulants for patients who need them, hinting that if two blood thinners are otherwise equivalent, warfarin’s potential anti-cancer benefit might tip the scales in its favor ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance)).

Another analysis focusing on cancer patients receiving anticoagulants found a suggestive survival advantage with warfarin. Cancer patients often require blood thinners to treat or prevent thromboembolism (clots) – for example, those with advanced pancreatic or gastric cancer are prone to clots and may be given either warfarin or other anticoagulants. Recent clinical observations reported that **pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancer patients on warfarin survived significantly longer than those on other anticoagulants** ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=against%20cancer,than%20those%20taking%20other%20anticoagulants)). Since all these patients needed anticoagulation, one explanation is that warfarin imparted an extra anti-cancer benefit that newer anticoagulants (e.g. heparins or DOACs) did not. This aligns with the mechanistic insights: **warfarin, unlike heparin or DOACs, inhibits the vitamin-K dependent processes (like Gas6/AXL signaling)** that tumors exploit ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%20%29,69)). It’s important to emphasize that warfarin is **not yet an approved cancer treatment**, and these outcomes come from retrospective analyses. But they provide real-world plausibility: warfarin’s effect is observable in patient populations, not just in mice. On the other hand, warfarin can cause bleeding and requires monitoring, so any therapeutic repurposing for cancer would need to carefully balance risks.

# Expert Opinions and Latest Perspectives (2023–2024)  
Experts are increasingly intrigued by the idea of repurposing warfarin in oncology, especially given the new mechanistic findings. The Columbia University team led by Dr. Wei Gu (whose study was published in *Cell Metabolism* in July 2023) expressed optimism about clinical translation. “Since warfarin has been extensively used in the clinic in cancer patients, we think warfarin could be tested soon as an anticancer drug, particularly for tumors with high levels of VKORC1L1 expression,” Dr. Gu noted ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=anticoagulants)). This statement highlights that warfarin’s target (VKORC1L1) might be especially relevant in certain tumors, and those could be logical trials for warfarin-based therapy. The same study revealed that VKORC1L1 is directly regulated by p53 ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=That%20may%20extend%20beyond%20pancreatic,more%20half%20of%20all%20cancers)), hinting that warfarin might work best in cancers with intact p53 signaling or where vitamin K metabolism is dysregulated. Other researchers, like those reviewing anticoagulants in cancer, point out that warfarin’s pleiotropic effects on tumors make it a compelling candidate for drug repurposing ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=%2822%20%29,69)). “Vitamin K antagonists have been associated with anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in preclinical and clinical studies since the 1960s,” wrote Kirane et al. in 2015 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Vitamin%20K%20%E2%80%9Cantagonists%E2%80%9D%20have%20been,poor%20patient%20outcome%20in%20several)), underscoring that the concept has a long history and has gained new traction with clearer mechanistic understanding. The consensus in recent literature is that **warfarin’s anti-cancer potential is biologically credible** and worth exploring in clinical trials. Indeed, a systematic review in 2024 concluded that warfarin (and heparins) showed significant tumor growth and metastasis inhibition in animal models, and called for translation of these findings into clinical research ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%206%2C158,tumour%20growth%20and%20metastasis%20inhibition)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=growth%20or%20metastasis%20in%20almost,69)). This kind of authoritative analysis reinforces that warfarin is no longer seen just as a blood thinner, but as a drug with **“dual-action”** potential: anticoagulant and anti-neoplastic.

It is also worth mentioning opposing or cautious views. Some oncologists note that prior clinical trials with warfarin, such as in lung cancer, did not yield clear benefits ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9363869/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Warfarin%20does%20not%20appear,anticoagulants%20observed%20in%20previous%20studies)), and emphasize that **prospective, controlled trials** are needed with modern patient cohorts and biomarkers (like AXL or VKORC1L1 levels) to identify where warfarin will be effective. Additionally, direct oral anticoagulants (which are now common) have not shown the same anti-tumor effects in preclinical studies ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Recently%2C%20four%20randomized%20clinical%20trials,dabigatran%20on%20tumour%20growth%20and)), and one trial even found better survival in head-neck cancer patients on a DOAC vs. warfarin ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Recently%2C%20four%20randomized%20clinical%20trials,dabigatran%20on%20tumour%20growth%20and)). This suggests **warfarin may not benefit all cancer scenarios**, and patient selection will be important. Overall, though, the expert sentiment in 2023–2024 is that warfarin’s anti-cancer mechanisms are real and documented, making it a strong candidate for **drug repurposing** in oncology ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Repurposing%20%E2%80%98old%E2%80%99%20drugs%20can%20facilitate,dose%20warfarin%20or%20with%20other)).

# Biological Plausibility of the Warfarin–Cancer Relationship (Warfarin treating “cancer”)  
Considering all the above, the **biological plausibility** of warfarin as a treatment for cancer is **high**. On a plausibility scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being “totally plausible – mechanism already described”), this relationship deserves a **score of 4 out of 5**, indicating it is *very plausible* and supported by some evidence in the literature. Each step of the postulated pathway can be assessed: 

- **Warfarin → treats/applied to treat → cancer:** This is **biologically plausible with growing support**. While warfarin is not a standard cancer drug, multiple studies have now described mechanisms by which warfarin can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)) ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). The exact connection “Warfarin treats cancer” has been **explored in laboratory models and retrospective human studies**, yielding positive results. For instance, warfarin has been shown to block critical cancer pathways (like AXL signaling) and induce cancer cell death (ferroptosis), resulting in slower tumor progression in mice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)) ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). Epidemiological data in humans further show lower cancer incidence and improved survival associated with warfarin use ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)) ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=against%20cancer,than%20those%20taking%20other%20anticoagulants)). These findings collectively validate that warfarin has anti-cancer effects – **a mechanism of action has been described**, although ongoing research is refining the details.  

- **Cancer → genetically_associated_with → MLH1:** This step is **completely supported by existing knowledge**. MLH1 is a well-known cancer-associated gene; germline mutations in MLH1 cause hereditary cancer syndromes, and somatic MLH1 loss is common in certain sporadic tumors (like microsatellite-unstable colorectal and endometrial cancers) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=population%20is%20highest%20for%20PMS2,by%20MSH3%20and%20MLH3%2C%20respectively)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%20colorectal%20carcinomas,result%20is%20the%20presence%20of)). Thus, the presence of MLH1 in the pathway simply reflects that the **disease “cancer” often involves genetic disruption of MLH1**. In other words, many cancers (especially gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers) are genetically linked to MLH1 dysfunction, so this association is biologically factual.  

- **MLH1 → genetically_associated_with → cancer:** This is essentially the same as the above; it reiterates that loss of MLH1 contributes to cancer. All **steps involving MLH1’s link to cancer are firmly plausible** and documented in literature. MLH1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation predisposes cells to malignancy ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=Due%20to%20a%20germline%20mutation%2C,44)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=population%20is%20highest%20for%20PMS2,by%20MSH3%20and%20MLH3%2C%20respectively)). 

- **Warfarin and MLH1 interplay:** The pathway as given implies a chain from warfarin to cancer possibly via MLH1, but **in reality there is no direct known connection between warfarin and the MLH1 gene**. Warfarin’s anti-cancer actions do not appear to restore DNA mismatch repair or specifically target MLH1-related pathways. Cancers driven by MLH1 deficiency (e.g. Lynch syndrome colon cancers) would likely respond to warfarin (if at all) through the alternative mechanisms discussed (immune effects, AXL inhibition, etc.), not through any change in MLH1 function. Indeed, warfarin’s prophylactic benefit in the general population was not notably seen in sporadic colon cancer incidence ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)), suggesting that warfarin is not particularly potent at preventing MLH1-driven tumors *per se*. That said, there is nothing biologically contradictory about using warfarin in an MLH1-mutant cancer – the drug could still induce ferroptosis or block metastasis in those cancer cells through other routes. So, while **warfarin does not “fix” MLH1, it could still act against an MLH1-associated cancer by independent mechanisms**. This means the absence of a direct Warfarin–MLH1 link does not invalidate the overall warfarin–cancer plausibility; it simply wasn’t a required part of warfarin’s known mechanism. 

**Has the exact mechanism been described?** If we interpret the “exact mechanism” as warfarin treating cancer via an MLH1-mediated pathway, then **no, that specific mechanistic link is not described in literature**. There is no research showing warfarin affecting the MLH1 gene or DNA mismatch repair directly. However, if we consider the broader question of warfarin’s mechanism in treating cancer, **yes – mechanisms have been described and backed by studies** (Gas6/AXL inhibition, interference in vitamin K-dependent redox pathways leading to ferroptosis, etc.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Repurposing%20%E2%80%98old%E2%80%99%20drugs%20can%20facilitate,dose%20warfarin%20or%20with%20other)) ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). Thus, the concept of warfarin as an anti-cancer agent does have a concrete mechanistic basis in scientific literature (just not involving MLH1 specifically). 

**Do the steps have support in literature?** Most of the individual steps in the proposed pathway are supported. Warfarin’s anti-cancer effects are supported by *some* literature (as detailed above, there are preclinical studies and population studies) – though it’s not yet an established therapy, the support is significant enough to move it beyond speculation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=Conclusions%20and%20Relevance)). The connections involving MLH1 and cancer are well-established in genetics literature ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/3/106#:~:text=population%20is%20highest%20for%20PMS2,by%20MSH3%20and%20MLH3%2C%20respectively)). The only “unsupported” step is an implied interaction between warfarin and the MLH1 pathway, which is not documented. But warfarin doesn’t need to act on MLH1 to affect cancer; it acts on other pathways. **All components of the chain are biologically plausible individually, and most are directly evidenced, just not the warfarin↔MLH1 link.**

**Plausibility score:** Given the above analysis, **I rate the warfarin–cancer relationship a 4/5**. It is *very plausible* biologically and even has experimental and observational support to bolster it. We are just shy of a 5/5 because warfarin is not yet an established cancer therapy in clinical practice, and some specifics (like the MLH1 angle) remain unproven. A score of 5 (“totally plausible – mechanism already described”) could be warranted in the sense that mechanisms *have* been described in peer-reviewed research ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Repurposing%20%E2%80%98old%E2%80%99%20drugs%20can%20facilitate,dose%20warfarin%20or%20with%20other)) ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). However, typically a 5/5 would imply the mechanism is widely accepted and the drug’s effect on the disease is essentially a known fact, which is not the case here. Warfarin’s anti-cancer role is promising but still emerging – we have proof-of-concept and plausible biology, but not full clinical validation. Therefore, **4/5 reflects that warfarin treating cancer makes biological sense and is backed by some literature, but isn’t fully confirmed or in routine use**. In summary, warfarin’s ability to treat cancer is far from “implausible” – on the contrary, it’s supported by modern research – yet it remains to be definitively proven in clinical trials. 

**Sources:** Recent studies and reviews provide the evidence and insights summarized above. For example, *Cancer Research* (2015) reported warfarin’s blockade of the Gas6-AXL pathway halting pancreatic cancer metastasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Repurposing%20%E2%80%98old%E2%80%99%20drugs%20can%20facilitate,dose%20warfarin%20or%20with%20other)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4572915/#:~:text=Activation%20of%20Axl%20by%20its,expressing)). *Cell Metabolism* (2023) described warfarin promoting ferroptosis in tumor cells via VKORC1L1 inhibition ([www.cuimc.columbia.edu](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/common-blood-thinner-may-double-cancer-therapy#:~:text=Warfarin%20is%20also%20a%20known,mouse%20model%20of%20pancreatic%20cancer)). A 2017 cohort study in *JAMA Internal Medicine* linked warfarin use to reduced cancer incidence in over a million adults ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820735/#:~:text=warfarin%20users%20and%20compared%20with,0.87%5D%3B%20and)) (published Nov 6, 2017). And a systematic review in *Frontiers in Oral Health* (Nov 2024) concluded that anticoagulants like warfarin show significant tumor-suppressive effects in animal models ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oral-health/articles/10.3389/froh.2024.1495942/full#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%206%2C158,tumour%20growth%20and%20metastasis%20inhibition)). These and other authoritative sources illustrate why the warfarin–cancer connection is taken seriously in current research. The ongoing challenge is translating this plausibility into proven therapy, by identifying which cancers and patients might benefit most from this old drug’s newfound tricks.
