## Question

Here is a pathway that describes how a drug might affect a disease:

**Pathway:** SmallMolecule: acetylsalicylate | affects | Gene: INS | affects | SmallMolecule: chenodiol | contributes_to | Disease: colorectal cancer

**Drug:** acetylsalicylate
**Disease:** colorectal cancer

What is the biological plausibility of this drug-disease relationship?

Score on a scale of:
- 1 = Totally implausible (doesn't make sense biologically and no support in literature)
- 2 = Seems implausible (no support in literature)

## Output

# Introduction  
Acetylsalicylate – better known as **aspirin** – is a small-molecule drug with well-documented anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties. **Colorectal cancer (CRC)** is a common malignancy of the colon or rectum, and numerous studies have found that regular aspirin use is associated with reduced CRC incidence ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=1.93%20million%20incidences%20globally%20,role%20for%20aspirin%20in%20CRC)). The biological pathway under consideration suggests a chain of effects: aspirin influences the **INS gene** (which encodes insulin), leading to changes in levels of **chenodiol** (chenodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid), which in turn impacts colorectal carcinogenesis. This report examines the plausibility of this aspirin–CRC mechanism by evaluating each step for biological sense and literature support, especially recent evidence (2023–2024). We will dissect key concepts, highlight research findings, real-world implications, expert analyses, and relevant data, before assigning a plausibility score (1–5) as requested. The scoring criteria range from 1 (“totally implausible”) to 5 (“totally plausible, mechanism already described”), with intermediate scores reflecting increasing biological credibility and literature support.

## Key Concepts and Pathway Overview  
**Aspirin (Acetylsalicylate):** Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), blocking prostaglandin production. This action underlies its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects, but aspirin also has recognized anti-cancer activity. Long-term aspirin use is linked to a lower risk of CRC – a relationship observed in epidemiological studies and clinical trials ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=1.93%20million%20incidences%20globally%20,role%20for%20aspirin%20in%20CRC)). In fact, aspirin’s role in CRC prevention is sufficiently established that some guidelines consider it for chemoprevention in at-risk adults (balancing benefits and risks) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=detection%20and%20effective%20prevention%20remain,effective%20drug%20for%20the)). However, the exact mechanisms by which aspirin prevents colorectal tumors remain an active area of research. Beyond COX inhibition, studies indicate aspirin has **pleiotropic effects** on cellular metabolism, immune responses, and signaling pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=focuses%20on%20the%20emerging%20role,as%20a%20key%20mechanism%20of)) ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=Long,of%20the%20American%20Cancer%20Society)). This broad activity opens multiple possible biological routes for aspirin’s anti-cancer influence.

**Insulin and the INS Gene:** The INS gene encodes **insulin**, a hormone central to glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. Insulin’s influence extends to cell growth and survival pathways; chronic hyperinsulinemia (excess insulin levels, often due to insulin resistance) can promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Background%3A%20Insulin%20stimulates%20cell%20proliferation,has%20not%20yet%20been%20quantified)). Epidemiologically, conditions of insulin dysregulation (such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome) are associated with higher CRC risk ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=cases,1.33%5D%2C%20I%282%29%3D76.6%25%2C%20Pheterogeneity%3D0.001)). A 2015 meta-analysis of 27 studies found that individuals with elevated insulin or C-peptide levels had about **33% higher odds** of developing colorectal adenomas (benign precursors to CRC) independent of obesity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%2027,95)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Independent%20of%20adiposity%2C%20higher,between%20obesity%20and%20CRA%20risk)). This suggests the **insulin/IGF axis** is a significant factor in colorectal tumorigenesis. Any intervention modifying insulin levels or action could thus plausibly affect CRC risk. Aspirin, interestingly, has been studied for its metabolic effects: high-dose salicylates can improve insulin sensitivity by inhibiting inflammatory signaling (IKKβ/NF-κB), thereby reducing insulin resistance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=activity%20,obtained%20by%20demonstrating%20that%20heterozygous)). In diabetic patients, short-term high-dose aspirin (~7 g/day) was shown to lower fasting blood glucose by ~25% and improve glucose uptake, essentially mitigating hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=treatment%20with%20aspirin%20%28%E2%88%BC7%20g%2Fd%29,in%20basal%20rates%20of%20hepatic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)). In obese rodent models too, salicylate treatment **reversed hyperinsulinemia** and other metabolic disturbances by sensitizing insulin signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=kinase%20cascade%20in%20the%20pathogenesis,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)). These findings indicate that aspirin can **“affect the INS gene”** in a functional sense – not by directly altering the DNA, but by modulating insulin levels or activity. In sum, conceptually: aspirin’s anti-inflammatory action might enhance insulin’s efficacy or reduce the need for excessive insulin, thereby potentially breaking a pro-cancerous metabolic loop.

**Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic Acid):** Chenodiol is the pharmaceutical name for chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a primary **bile acid** produced in the liver from cholesterol. Physiologically, bile acids like CDCA aid in digesting and absorbing fats, and also act as signaling molecules regulating metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=obesity%20and%20diabetes%20%281%20%29,bile%20acid%20pool%20and%20excretion)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=dramatically%20expands%20the%20body%E2%80%99s%20metabolic,genetic%20susceptibility%20to%20colitis%20in)). Chenodiol has been used clinically (at gram doses) to dissolve gallstones by reducing cholesterol in bile. In the context of this pathway, CDCA is depicted as a mediator between insulin and colorectal cancer. There is a biological basis for connecting insulin to bile acids: insulin signaling is known to regulate bile acid synthesis in the liver. Notably, insulin can **inhibit the expression** of CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid production ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=gene,which%20inhibits%20human%20CYP7A1%20gene)). Experimental studies show that in diabetes or insulin-deficient states, bile acid synthesis increases significantly, whereas insulin’s presence tends to suppress bile acid generation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)). In human hepatocytes, insulin has a dual effect on CYP7A1 transcription – initially stimulating, but with prolonged exposure, inhibiting bile acid synthesis via transcriptional regulators ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=but%20inhibited%20CYP7A1%20expression%20after,1c%20recruitment%20to%20CYP7A1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=chromatin,synthesis%20and%20dyslipidemia%20in%20diabetes)). The net effect in chronic hyperinsulinemia is a downregulation of bile acid production. Thus, changes in insulin levels could alter the pool of bile acids like CDCA. For example, improving insulin sensitivity (as aspirin might) could maintain a normal check on bile acid synthesis, whereas insulin resistance might dysregulate bile acid metabolism. Beyond the liver, emerging research highlights a **gut microbiome–bile acid–metabolism axis**, where bile acids also feedback into glucose and lipid metabolism and interact with gut microbes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=dramatically%20expands%20the%20body%E2%80%99s%20metabolic,genetic%20susceptibility%20to%20colitis%20in)). CDCA specifically is an agonist for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) – receptors that influence metabolic and immune processes in the intestine and liver. Because of these roles, any substantial change in CDCA levels or signaling could plausibly affect colorectal epithelial biology.

**Colorectal Cancer and Bile Acids:** The idea that bile acids contribute to colorectal cancer has a long history in gastrointestinal research. High-fat or Western diets – which elevate bile acid secretion – have been linked to greater colon tumorigenesis in animal models. Certain **secondary bile acids** (produced by gut bacterial modification of primary bile acids) are known to have tumor-promoting effects. For instance, deoxycholic acid (DCA, a secondary bile acid derived from cholic acid) can cause DNA damage, oxidative stress, and activation of pro-carcinogenic signaling in colon cells ([dmr.amegroups.org](https://dmr.amegroups.org/article/view/7328/html#:~:text=Biliary%20acids%20as%20promoters%20of,Significant%20increase%20of%20tyrosine)). Lithocholic acid (a metabolite of CDCA) has also been cited as cytotoxic and potentially carcinogenic to the colonic epithelium ([dmr.amegroups.org](https://dmr.amegroups.org/article/view/7328/html#:~:text=Biliary%20acids%20as%20promoters%20of,Significant%20increase%20of%20tyrosine)). Epidemiological studies in humans have yielded mixed but generally concerning results about bile acids: a comprehensive **2025 systematic review and meta-analysis** of fecal bile acid levels found that patients with colorectal neoplasia have significantly higher concentrations of multiple bile acids, including CDCA. Specifically, fecal chenodeoxycholic acid levels were on average higher in individuals with colorectal adenomas or cancer (standardized mean difference ~0.35–0.61 in cases vs. controls, *p* < 0.01) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)). This suggests that **elevated CDCA (and other bile acids) in the colon correlate with increased CRC risk** or presence. The mechanism could be direct mucosal injury and promotion of inflammation or indirect effects via gut microbiota changes. Indeed, the same 2025 analysis noted that higher total fecal bile acids (cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, ursodeoxycholic) distinguished high-risk individuals and CRC patients from low-risk groups ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=CRC%20risk%20meta,CI)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=0.04%E2%80%930.80%2C%20P%E2%80%89%3D%E2%80%890.03%3B%20CDCA%3A%20SMD%E2%80%89%3D%E2%80%890.61%2C%2095,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)). Such data support the notion that **chenodiol “contributes to” colorectal cancer**, at least as a risk factor when present in excess. However, it’s worth noting the complexity: not all evidence paints bile acids purely as villains. Paradoxically, a 2025 experimental study observed *lower* circulating bile acids (including CDCA) in CRC patients compared to healthy controls, and found that adding chenodeoxycholic acid to colon cancer cell cultures *inhibited* their proliferation and invasive behavior ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40790066/#:~:text=samples%20from%2070%20controls%20and,EMT%2C%20protecting%20against%20CRC%20development)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40790066/#:~:text=patients%20than%20in%20the%20age,in%20CRC%20prognosis%20and%20their)). CDCA treatment reduced cancer cell EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) and sphere formation significantly in that study ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40790066/#:~:text=patients%20than%20in%20the%20age,EMT%2C%20protecting%20against%20CRC%20development)), hinting that **bile acids might also have context-dependent anti-tumor effects**. These nuances likely reflect differences between systemic vs. luminal concentrations and primary vs. secondary bile acid actions. Overall, the weight of evidence and expert consensus lean toward bile acids (especially secondary ones) being promotive of colon cancer when chronically elevated in the colonic lumen ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)). This makes it biologically plausible that altering bile acid levels or effects could influence CRC development.

## Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)  
Contemporary research continues to unravel how aspirin and metabolic factors intersect in colorectal cancer prevention. In 2023, a review in *Exploration of Targeted Anti-tumor Therapy* highlighted aspirin’s role as a regulator of **cancer cell metabolism** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=focuses%20on%20the%20emerging%20role,as%20a%20key%20mechanism%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=regulation%20of%20enzymes%20involved%20in,target%20this%20important%20hallmark%20of)). While traditionally aspirin’s benefit was attributed to COX-2 inhibition in tumor cells and stromal cells, newer studies show that aspirin can “reprogram” cancer metabolism – for example, by modulating glycolysis, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, and glutamine utilization in colorectal cancer cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=increased%20demand%20for%20biosynthetic%20intermediates,Importantly%2C%20as%20aspirin%20treatment)). Such metabolic reprogramming could tie into systemic effects like insulin signaling. Indeed, aspirin’s ability to activate AMPK (a key energy-sensing enzyme) provides a molecular link between its anti-inflammatory action and improved insulin sensitivity observed in metabolic disease models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=activity%20,obtained%20by%20demonstrating%20that%20heterozygous)). Researchers are now considering that aspirin’s chemopreventive efficacy may partly stem from correcting pro-tumorigenic metabolic hallmarks (such as hyperinsulinemia or dyslipidemia) in the tumor microenvironment and the whole organism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=oncogenic%20pathways%20such%20as%20hypoxia,with%20specific%20metabolic%20inhibitors%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=potentially%20other%20cancers,inhibitors%20currently%20undergoing%20clinical%20investigation)). 

Meanwhile, the role of bile acids in CRC has seen renewed examination through the lens of the gut microbiome. The 2025 meta-analysis cited above ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)) is an example, consolidating data from many studies and confirming that *higher fecal bile acid levels are associated with CRC incidence*. This aligns with the idea that gut microbial activity (which converts primary to secondary bile acids) and resulting bile acid profiles are part of colorectal carcinogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20suggest%20the%20role,cholic%20acid%29%2C%20CDCA)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=dramatically%20expands%20the%20body%E2%80%99s%20metabolic,genetic%20susceptibility%20to%20colitis%20in)). It underscores that manipulating bile acids could be a preventive or therapeutic angle. In fact, there has been interest in whether interventions like **bile acid sequestrants** (resins that bind bile acids in the gut) might reduce colorectal adenoma formation by lowering colonic bile acid exposure. Though not yet standard, this concept is being revisited as we better understand bile acid signaling in the colon ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=dietary%20lipids%20and%20promote%20their,18)). 

Notably, in April 2024 new evidence emerged for *another* mechanism of aspirin in CRC prevention – the immune system. An Italian study (METACCRE trial) reported that long-term daily aspirin use is associated with enhanced immune surveillance in colorectal tumors ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=Long,of%20the%20American%20Cancer%20Society)) ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=colorectal%20cancer%2C%20investigators%20in%20Italy,the%20University%20Hospital%20of%20Padova)). Tumor samples from aspirin users had **higher infiltration of immune cells** and upregulated immune-stimulatory signals (e.g. increased CD80 expression on immune cells) compared to non-users ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=Compared%20with%20tissue%20samples%20from,that%20in%20patients%20with%20rectal)). This suggests aspirin may help the body’s immune system recognize and attack emerging cancer cells, adding an immunologic dimension to its protective effect. While this finding doesn’t directly involve insulin or bile acids, it reinforces that aspirin’s anti-cancer actions are **multifaceted**. Experts now view aspirin as influencing inflammatory pathways, metabolic pathways, and immune pathways in parallel ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=focuses%20on%20the%20emerging%20role,as%20a%20key%20mechanism%20of)) ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=Long,of%20the%20American%20Cancer%20Society)). The convergence of these pathways is especially relevant in CRC, which is a disease influenced by chronic inflammation (e.g. COX-2, IL-6), metabolic state (obesity/insulin), gut microbiota, and immune evasion. Thus, the proposed aspirin–insulin–chenodeoxycholic acid–CRC pathway fits into the broader landscape of current research that is piecing together metabolism and cancer prevention.

## Current Applications and Real-World Implementations  
In practice, **aspirin is already used for CRC risk reduction** in certain scenarios. For example, low-dose aspirin (81–325 mg daily) for at least 5–10 years has been shown to lower the incidence of colorectal polyps and cancers in middle-aged adults, and some health authorities recommend it for individuals aged 50–59 who have cardiovascular risk factors and a low risk of bleeding ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=detection%20and%20effective%20prevention%20remain,effective%20drug%20for%20the)). This dual benefit for heart health and possibly cancer prevention makes aspirin an attractive preventive agent. The real-world implementation underscores that the aspirin–CRC link is more than theoretical; it has been observed in clinical outcomes. However, clinicians still primarily attribute this to aspirin’s anti-inflammatory and anti-Platelet effects, rather than a defined metabolic cascade. If the insulin–bile acid pathway plays a role, it might be **indirect**: for instance, aspirin’s systemic anti-inflammatory action could improve insulin sensitivity in overweight patients, which in turn might normalize bile acid metabolism and reduce a growth-promoting colonic environment. Such a scenario, while plausible, remains a subject of investigation rather than a guideline-supported rationale.

**Chenodiol**, on the other hand, is not used to treat or prevent colorectal cancer. It is prescribed to dissolve gallstones and has also been studied in certain metabolic liver diseases. There is no clinical recommendation to give chenodeoxycholic acid for any oncology purpose – if anything, excessive bile acids are something to mitigate in colon cancer prevention. However, the role of **insulin-sensitizing drugs** (like metformin, an anti-diabetic medication) is being actively explored in cancer prevention trials, including for colorectal cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4107999/#:~:text=Insulin%20therapy%20and%20colorectal%20cancer,Danqing%20Jing%20%5E%7B1%7D)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Hyperinsulinemia%2C%20insulin%20resistance%20and%20colorectal,circulating)). Metformin lowers insulin levels and has been associated with lower cancer incidence in diabetic cohorts, highlighting that **targeting insulin pathways is a viable strategy** against cancer development. Aspirin’s much lesser-known metabolic effect could conceptually parallel this. In addition, lifestyle interventions (diet, weight loss, exercise) that reduce insulin resistance also lower CRC risk – reinforcing each link in the chain (less insulin, healthier bile acid profile, less cancer) in a real-world context. For example, diets high in fiber can bind bile acids and reduce their contact with the colon lining, potentially lowering CRC risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=Several%20cross,dietary%20habits%20and%20fecal%20composition)). Likewise, weight loss reduces hyperinsulinemia and systemic inflammation, which is thought to diminish polyp formation rates ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Independent%20of%20adiposity%2C%20higher,between%20obesity%20and%20CRA%20risk)) ([bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-018-0835-1#:~:text=Diabetes%20mellitus%20and%20hyperglycemia%20control,ZJ%2C%20Zheng%20ZJ%2C%20Kan%20H)). These practical observations lend credence to the idea that the insulin–bile acid axis is relevant outside the lab.

## Expert Opinions and Analysis  
Authoritative sources and experts generally agree that aspirin’s chemopreventive effect in colorectal cancer is **very plausible** and backed by a body of evidence. The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) have noted that consistent aspirin use has a protective association with CRC, though they also caution about side effects. Experts like Dr. John Burn (who led large aspirin trials in Lynch syndrome patients) emphasize that aspirin “has a biological effect on the early steps of colorectal carcinogenesis,” citing both COX-dependent and COX-independent pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=detection%20and%20effective%20prevention%20remain,effective%20drug%20for%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=Aspirin%20and%20CRC)). Many researchers underscore COX-2 inhibition as the primary mechanism, but also acknowledge that **insulin and growth factor signaling could be involved**. As described in a 2016 literature review, aspirin can inhibit the NF-κB pathway (downstream of inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance) and thereby might reduce cancer-promoting signals related to obesity and metabolic syndrome  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)). Dr. Andrew Chan and colleagues have pointed out that colorectal neoplasia in diabetics or obese individuals might be driven by hyperinsulinemia and elevated IGF-1, and they speculate that part of aspirin’s benefit could accrue from countering this pro-growth milieu (for instance, by reducing systemic inflammation) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Background%3A%20Insulin%20stimulates%20cell%20proliferation,has%20not%20yet%20been%20quantified)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=cases,1.33%5D%2C%20I%282%29%3D76.6%25%2C%20Pheterogeneity%3D0.001)). In essence, experts find it biologically sensible that anything lowering chronic insulin levels or resistance would curb one stimulus for tumor growth. 

On the bile acid front, gastroenterology experts have long regarded high colonic bile acid exposure as a risk factor for CRC. Dr. Stephen O’Keefe, for example, notes that populations with low CRC incidence (e.g. rural Africans) typically have low fecal bile acid concentrations due to high-fiber diets, whereas Western diets lead to high bile acid output and higher CRC rates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=Several%20cross,dietary%20habits%20and%20fecal%20composition)). Oncologists and basic scientists writing in *Frontiers in Oncology* (2022) outline how secondary bile acids like DCA activate **EGFR** and **Wnt signaling** in colon epithelial cells, driving proliferation and DNA damage ([dmr.amegroups.org](https://dmr.amegroups.org/article/view/7328/html#:~:text=Biliary%20acids%20as%20promoters%20of,Significant%20increase%20of%20tyrosine)). They classify bile acids as “tumor promoters” in the context of colorectal carcinogenesis. These expert views support each component of the proposed pathway: (1) aspirin as an anti-cancer agent, (2) insulin as a growth promoter to be wary of, and (3) bile acids as environmental carcinogens in the colon. However, it’s important to note that **no expert has explicitly framed the mechanism exactly as “aspirin → insulin → bile acid → less CRC” in published literature**. Instead, they discuss these links in isolation or as part of broader multifactorial models. For instance, a leading theory for aspirin in cancer prevention involves platelet modulation and COX-2 inhibition in tumors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9250486/#:~:text=COX,that%20the%20effect%20of%20aspirin)), rather than metabolic mediation. Nonetheless, some interdisciplinary analyses (such as emerging metabolic-focused reviews ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=focuses%20on%20the%20emerging%20role,as%20a%20key%20mechanism%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=regulation%20of%20enzymes%20involved%20in,target%20this%20important%20hallmark%20of))) are piecing together how metabolic reprogramming (including insulin signaling) might intersect with aspirin’s effects. In summary, authoritative voices find each step **biologically credible**, even if the full chain hasn’t been definitively proven in one go.

## Relevant Data and Statistics  
- **Aspirin’s Impact on CRC Risk:** Extensive epidemiological data indicate that regular aspirin use can reduce colorectal cancer incidence by roughly 20–40%, especially with ≥5 years of use ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=1.93%20million%20incidences%20globally%20,role%20for%20aspirin%20in%20CRC)). For example, the ASPREE trial and long-term follow-ups of aspirin polyp prevention studies showed fewer colorectal cancers or polyps in aspirin-treated groups compared to placebo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=detection%20and%20effective%20prevention%20remain,effective%20drug%20for%20the)). However, the benefit appears after several years of continuous use (consistent with affecting early carcinogenic processes).  
- **Hyperinsulinemia and CRC:** Individuals with type 2 diabetes have about a **30%–50% higher risk** of colorectal cancer compared to non-diabetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4989384/#:~:text=Type%202%20diabetes%20mellitus%20and,in%20the%20newly%20diagnosed%20T2DM)). A meta-analysis (2014) focusing on diabetics even suggested that those on long-term insulin therapy (indicative of severe insulin resistance or deficiency) had an elevated CRC risk, possibly due to higher insulin/IGF exposure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4107999/#:~:text=patients%3A%20a%20systemic%20review%20and,Danqing%20Jing%20%5E%7B1%7D)) ([diagnosticpathology.biomedcentral.com](https://diagnosticpathology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-1596-8-180#:~:text=Insulin%20therapy%20contributes%20to%20the,therapy%20and%20colorectal%20cancer%20risk)). Meanwhile, the 2015 meta-analysis on insulin resistance markers found an odds ratio of **1.33** for colorectal adenomas in the highest vs. lowest insulin level groups ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%2027,95)). These numbers reinforce that insulin is a significant factor in colorectal neoplasia development.  
- **Aspirin and Metabolic Improvements:** In a 2002 clinical study on diabetic patients, two weeks of high-dose aspirin reduced fasting plasma glucose by ~25% (from ~180 mg/dL to ~135 mg/dL) and lowered triglycerides by 50%, while improving insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by ~20% ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=treatment%20with%20aspirin%20%28%E2%88%BC7%20g%2Fd%29,in%20basal%20rates%20of%20hepatic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=glucose%20production%20and%20a%20%E2%88%BC20,treating%20type%202%20diabetes%20mellitus)). This was accompanied by reduced markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=treatment%20with%20aspirin%20%28%E2%88%BC7%20g%2Fd%29,in%20basal%20rates%20of%20hepatic)). Such data demonstrate aspirin’s capacity to favorably shift metabolic parameters that are linked to cancer risk. (These effects required high doses; low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection hasn’t shown major metabolic changes in shorter trials ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=match%20at%20L62%20have%20demonstrated,In%20view%20of)).)  
- **Insulin Regulation of Bile Acids:** Laboratory studies quantify insulin’s effect on bile acid synthesis. For example, Li et al. (2006) reported that insulin exposure in human hepatocyte cultures initially doubled CYP7A1 mRNA (within 4 hours) but then **suppressed it by >50%** after 24 hours, mediated by insulin-responsive transcription factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=hepatocytes.%20Real,1c%20expression%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=human%20primary%20hepatocytes,synthesis%20and%20dyslipidemia%20in%20diabetes)). In diabetic mice, hepatic bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1 activity) was significantly higher than in insulin-treated mice, confirming insulin’s inhibitory role in vivo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)). These results provide a mechanistic basis: high insulin signaling chronically dampens bile acid production rates.  
- **Bile Acids and CRC Risk Metrics:** The 2025 fecal bile acid meta-analysis combined data from multiple studies (over 1000 subjects across various countries). It found that fecal CDCA levels were on average **0.6 standard deviations higher** in CRC patients than in controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=confidence%20interval%20,risk)) – a statistically significant difference. Deoxycholic acid was ~0.33 SD higher in CRC cases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=,CI)). Another earlier study (Bayerdörffer et al., *Gastroenterology* 1993) often cited in this field showed men with colon adenomas had about **2-fold higher** serum deoxycholic acid levels than controls, linking systemic bile acid exposure to neoplasia ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2015.2939#:~:text=International%20Journal%20of%20Oncology%20,Google%20Scholar%20%3A%20PubMed%2FNCBI%203)). These quantitative findings solidify that elevated bile acids are more than a random observation; they consistently associate with greater colorectal neoplasia risk.  
- **Immune Effects of Aspirin (2024 study):** In the recent 2024 study of CRC surgical specimens, only 12% of patients were aspirin users, yet in that subgroup there was a marked reduction in lymph node metastases and a higher density of cytotoxic T-cells in the tumor microenvironment ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=Study%20reveals%20that%20aspirin%20helps,detect%20and%20target%20cancer%20cells)) ([newsroom.wiley.com](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/How-does-aspirin-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer-development-and-progression/default.aspx#:~:text=To%20investigate%20the%20effects%20of,the%20University%20Hospital%20of%20Padova)). While not directly about the insulin pathway, this quantifiable outcome (fewer metastatic lymph nodes) underlines aspirin’s significant biological impact on cancer progression, indirectly supporting the idea that aspirin has systemic effects beneficial against cancer.

## Plausibility Assessment of the Aspirin–Insulin–Chenodiol–CRC Pathway  
Bringing together the above evidence and reasoning, we evaluate the **biological plausibility** of the proposed drug–disease pathway:

- **Has the exact mechanism been described in literature?** – No single study to date has explicitly outlined *“aspirin affects insulin which alters chenodeoxycholic acid leading to reduced colorectal cancer”* as a complete mechanism. This pathway is a composite hypothesis. However, *each link in the chain has some support in scientific literature*: Aspirin’s effect on insulin signaling is documented in metabolic research ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)), insulin’s effect on bile acid synthesis is established in hepatology studies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)), and bile acids’ effect on colorectal cancer is supported by both epidemiological and experimental studies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)). The integration of these steps is biologically coherent (insulin and bile acids are metabolically coupled, and both relate to CRC risk). It just hasn’t been formally tested as a unified mechanism for aspirin’s chemoprevention.

- **Support for individual steps:** All steps are **biologically plausible**, and most are backed by empirical data. Aspirin improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation is plausible, with some evidence in both animals and humans (high-dose contexts) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=kinase%20cascade%20in%20the%20pathogenesis,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)). Insulin modulating bile acids is not only plausible but demonstrable (insulin signaling pathways directly regulate bile acid synthetic enzymes) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)). High bile acid levels contributing to colon cancer is very plausible and supported by decades of research ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)). In fact, two of the three intermediate steps (*aspirin → less insulin resistance* and *bile acid → cancer promotion*) are well-discussed in literature, even if they haven’t been linked together in a single causal chain with aspirin. 

- **Overall mechanism plausibility:** Considering the above, the **concept that aspirin might reduce colorectal cancer risk by modulating insulin levels and hence bile acid metabolism is reasonable**. It fits known biology: by reducing systemic inflammation, aspirin could improve metabolic parameters (like insulin dynamics) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)), leading to a healthier balance of bile acids, thereby reducing a source of colonic mucosal stress. This does not contradict known mechanisms (such as COX-2 inhibition); it likely complements them. It’s important to note potential gaps – for example, aspirin’s measurable effects on insulin are mainly at high doses not commonly used for chemoprevention, and bile acid metabolism is complex with sometimes conflicting outcomes (recall that CDCA added to cells showed anti-proliferative effects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40790066/#:~:text=patients%20than%20in%20the%20age,in%20CRC%20prognosis%20and%20their)) despite epidemiologic associations linking high bile acids to cancer). These nuances prevent us from calling the pathway *proven*, but they don’t render it implausible. Each piece is credible on its own, and they connect in a logical sequence.

**Score (1–5):** **4 – Very plausible (some support in literature).** This score reflects that the mechanism has **partial backing from scientific studies** and aligns with current understanding of cancer biology. It is more than a speculative idea (since most steps are evidenced), but not “totally proven” or universally accepted as aspirin’s mode of action (which would warrant a 5). In other words, the relationship between aspirin and colorectal cancer via the insulin–chenodeoxycholic acid pathway is **biologically very plausible**, with multiple research findings lending support, though a complete direct demonstration in the literature is yet to be seen. This rating acknowledges the supportive data (as detailed above) while recognizing that further research would be needed to fully verify this specific chain of causation.

**Sources:** The analysis above is supported by recent and authoritative sources, including a 2023 review on aspirin’s role in cancer metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=focuses%20on%20the%20emerging%20role,as%20a%20key%20mechanism%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10501897/#:~:text=regulation%20of%20enzymes%20involved%20in,target%20this%20important%20hallmark%20of)) (August 28, 2023), a 2025 meta-analysis on bile acids and CRC risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=extracted%20data%20from%20them,analysis%2C%20the%20effect)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11698987/#:~:text=95,a%20higher%20risk%2Fincidence%20of%20CRC)) (Sci. Reports, Jan 4, 2025), and multiple peer-reviewed studies on insulin’s link to CRC ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26169471/#:~:text=Results%3A%20A%20total%20of%2027,95)), aspirin’s metabolic effects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC150979/#:~:text=Insulin%20resistance%20is%20a%20primary,key%20downstream%20mediator%20in%20this)), and bile acid biology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1576296/#:~:text=Bile%20acid%20synthesis%20and%20pool,1%CE%B1%20transactivation%20of%20the%20CYP7A1)). These provide a current, evidence-based foundation for concluding that the aspirin–insulin–chenodiol–CRC pathway is highly plausible biologically, meriting a score of 4/5 on the plausibility scale.
